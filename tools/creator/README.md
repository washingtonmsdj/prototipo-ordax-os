# OrdaX Creator

`tools/creator/` is the single source root for OrdaX physical-media creation.

The permanent end-user experience belongs inside OrdaX Desktop, but the prototype may publish a small `ordax-creator.exe` shell before the complete Desktop UI exists. Both must use the same Creator Core; a second flasher policy implementation is forbidden.

Goal: prepare verified **USB media for the public MVP** without requiring Codex, WSL, QEMU or a kernel toolchain on the user's machine. Native SSD/NVMe/HDD work is retained as a post-MVP foundation and is not a public MVP capability.

```text
tools/creator/
  core/                 # host-neutral policy, payload verification and write planning
  proof/                # non-destructive disposable GPT/filesystem proof
  cmd/
    ordax-creator/      # thin prototype CLI/shell around the same Core
  platform/
    windows/            # future thin raw-disk/elevation adapter
    linux/              # optional later adapter
    macos/              # optional later adapter
```

The shared Core owns:

- artifact selection;
- canonical two-partition validation;
- signature/hash policy boundaries;
- Creator payload integrity verification;
- transactional disposable filesystem-tree staging;
- write-plan generation;
- fail-closed physical-write authorization;
- post-write verification contract;
- recovery/retry semantics.

Platform adapters own only unavoidable host API integration. They may not define another OrdaX layout or security policy.

## Creator payload boundary

`source_path` in `docs/contracts/minimal-bootstrap.json` means a slash-separated path **relative to the assembled Creator payload root**, never an arbitrary developer/runner path.

Before any future physical `apply`, the Core must independently verify every local source artifact against the SHA-256 pinned in the manifest.

The Core rejects:

- absolute source paths;
- `..` traversal;
- backslash/path ambiguity;
- symlink traversal in the payload;
- non-regular artifact files;
- malformed hashes or modes;
- duplicate target paths on the same partition;
- missing or byte-modified artifacts.

Payload verification remains independent from destructive authorization. Verified bytes do not imply permission to write a disk.

## Transactional `stage-tree`

`stage-tree` is a non-destructive Creator Core operation. It preflights the complete manifest/payload, builds a sibling temporary tree, fsyncs and re-hashes copied files, creates the logical runtime roots, and publishes the output only after all checks pass.

Published shape:

```text
ORDAX-ESP/
ORDAX/
```

Main-partition targets are required to live below `/ordax/...` and map below the `ORDAX/` mirror. `releases/`, `state/` and `home/` are created under that mirror.

On any copy-time or validation failure, no partial payload is published at the requested output path and temporary staging is removed.

## Disposable GPT/filesystem proof

The source tree now also contains `tools/creator/proof/disposable_media.py`, which consumes a fully staged Creator tree and creates a **regular disposable RAW file only**. It proves the geometry in `docs/contracts/physical-media.json`:

```text
GPT
├── ORDAX-ESP  FAT32  256 MiB
└── ORDAX      ext4   fill remaining usable space
```

The proof verifies:

- valid GPT;
- exactly two partitions;
- expected start LBAs/type GUIDs;
- FAT32/ext4 filesystem types and labels;
- staged file SHA-256 after extraction from each filesystem;
- required ext4 directories;
- partition-image bytes after embedding into the RAW file;
- `physical_write_authorized=false` throughout.

`.github/workflows/creator-disposable-media.yml` routes its input through the Creator Core `stage-tree` first, then runs the GPT/filesystem proof. CI publishes only `proof.json`; the RAW is ephemeral and deleted.

## MVP durable USB migration boundary

The existing three-partition prepared-media path (`ORDAX-ESP + ORDAX + ORDAX-DATA`) is retained only as an Owner/Development hardware-validation bridge. Its contract is `docs/contracts/physical-prepared-media.json`, and it must not be promoted as the Stable/MVP final layout.

The public MVP target is `docs/contracts/portable-usb-v2.json`:

```text
ORDAX-ESP   FAT32
ORDAX-DATA  exFAT
  .ordax/base/stable-base.erofs
  .ordax/releases/<commit>/system.erofs
  .ordax/state/persistent-state.img
```

The Creator Core already owns the v2 geometry through `PlanPortableTargetStorage` and the final 39-operation application plan. Physical v2 apply remains disabled until the disposable Portable media/runtime-v4 QEMU+UEFI proof, canonical trust, fresh Stable/MVP owner authorization for the 17-artifact v4 payload and physical USB gates close in order.

## Release bootstrap inputs

The release-channel pointer is now canonical and hash-bound in the minimal-bootstrap manifest:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/config/release-envelope-url
 -> https://github.com/washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os/releases/latest/download/release-envelope.json
```

This URL is only a delivery selector. Authenticity depends on the canonical Ed25519 public trust anchor now pinned and hash-bound in the minimal bootstrap:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json
```

No private signing key belongs in Git, Creator payloads or downloadable installers.

## Current implementation state

The Windows Creator now has a native graphical shell. Normal users select an eligible USB in the window and never need Prompt, PowerShell or a `.cmd` file. The destructive path remains fail-closed until a publisher-bound physical candidate is available.

The development `OrdaX-Creator.exe` is intentionally useful for the graphical workflow, automatic development updates and safe USB discovery, but it still cannot acquire a raw writer: canonical public trust is resolved, while explicit Stable/MVP owner authorization and the public physical-apply boundary remain closed. This separation prevents an ordinary development build from becoming destructive by accident.

The final Portable physical flow is implemented behind the isolated tagged/publisher boundary, but it is not yet a public Creator capability:

```text
canonical public trust
 -> exact Portable policy bindings
 -> canonical v4 signed/materialized aggregate proof
 -> bind exact public proof SHA/source/HTTPS release identity
 -> fresh Stable/MVP owner authorization contract
 -> signed physical channel
 -> select and revalidate exact USB target
 -> target-specific destructive confirmation
 -> Windows UAC elevation
 -> write exact two-partition GPT
 -> format ORDAX-ESP FAT32 + ORDAX-DATA exFAT
 -> materialize 17 exact artifacts, including Local AI runtime + release reference
 -> flush + per-artifact SHA-256/size readback
 -> verify final geometry, labels and capacity
 -> success / fail-closed result
```

The v4 physical plan adds `local-ai-runtime-image` and `local-ai-runtime-ref` to the previous 15-artifact shape; the previous authorization context is intentionally not reusable. There is no target-sized whole-disk RAW image in this final path. Canonical publisher trust is now pinned, but owner consent is deliberately **not reachable** until the operator-controlled canonical v4 signing/materialization flow has produced its aggregate public receipt.

The target-specific Portable media/application plan must use the **canonical release source commit** bound by `physical-write-authorization.json -> release_binding.source_commit`. The physical writer binary records its own build/Git commit separately as writer provenance and must never substitute that writer SHA for the release SHA. `prepare-portable` and `apply-portable` fail closed unless the plan source commit matches the embedded canonical release source commit, and the v4 path requires exactly 17 artifact sources.

Bind that receipt non-destructively first:

```text
python tools/creator/bind_canonical_v4_release_proof.py <canonical-v4-release-proof.json>
```

This validates the pinned trust, exact source/release identities and safe physical flags, stores only
the public receipt under `docs/evidence/`, and advances the contract only to owner-consent pending.
It never selects/touches media, invokes the writer or authorizes a write. The old first-USB
development consent is not reusable.

Read-only authorization preflight:

```text
python tools/creator/authorize_physical_write.py check
```

The future authorization mode changes only the source-controlled authorization contract; it does not touch a physical device or invoke the writer. It requires the exact scope, release sequence and confirmation phrase:

```text
python tools/creator/authorize_physical_write.py authorize \
  --confirm-scope first-real-stable-mvp-usb-proof \
  --confirm-release-sequence <current-sequence> \
  --authorize AUTHORIZE_FIRST_REAL_STABLE_MVP_USB_PROOF
```

Do not run `authorize` until the repository owner has explicitly chosen to authorize that exact Stable/MVP physical proof. Candidate materialization and the later target-specific destructive confirmation remain separate gates.

Examples for non-destructive engineering verification:

```text
ordax-creator verify-payload \
  --manifest docs/contracts/minimal-bootstrap.json \
  --payload-root <assembled-payload-directory>

ordax-creator stage-tree \
  --manifest docs/contracts/minimal-bootstrap.json \
  --payload-root <assembled-payload-directory> \
  --output-root <disposable-directory>
```

See `docs/CREATOR-INSTALLATION.md`, `docs/PHYSICAL-MEDIA.md`, `docs/RELEASE-TRUST-CEREMONY.md` and `docs/PROMOTION-GATES.md`.

## Native installation foundation — post-MVP

The durable Native target geometry, target-identity binding, boot assets and non-destructive planners remain implemented and covered by engineering proofs.

`ordax-creator plan-native` and related Native commands belong to the **engineering CLI/proof surface**, not to the public Stable/MVP Creator experience. The official MVP Creator UI prepares removable OrdaX USB media only and must not advertise or authorize internal-disk installation.

Native code remains in the same Creator Core so a later product promotion can activate it deliberately without creating a second installer or divergent storage policy.

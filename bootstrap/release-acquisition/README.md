# Release Acquisition Bootstrap

Status: CLEAN-ROOM CANDIDATE — PHYSICAL USE NOT AUTHORIZED

This directory owns only the pre-release client required to acquire a verified OrdaX release after minimal network bring-up.

It does **not** own a full Git checkout, compiler, source build, SSH service, Remote Core or Control Plane.

## Runtime chain

```text
network ready
 -> fetch signed release envelope over HTTPS
 -> verify Ed25519 signature against local public trust anchor
 -> parse the exact signed manifest payload
 -> validate repository/commit/artifact policy
 -> fetch artifacts over HTTPS
 -> verify exact size + SHA-256
 -> fsync staging release
 -> atomically materialize /ordax/releases/<commit>
 -> optional activation boundary
 -> atomically switch /ordax/current only for install
```

A failed download, signature, hash, size or activation check never replaces the current known-good release. The `materialize` command deliberately stops before activation and cannot retarget the canonical `/ordax/current` pointer.

## Cryptographic envelope

The protocol deliberately does not invent canonical JSON. The envelope carries the **exact manifest bytes** as base64 and the Ed25519 signature is computed over those exact bytes.

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-envelope/1",
  "payload": "<base64 exact manifest bytes>",
  "signature": "<base64 Ed25519 signature over payload bytes>",
  "key_id": "prototype-1"
}
```

The local public trust anchor is a small regular file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-trust/1",
  "key_id": "prototype-1",
  "public_key_base64": "<32-byte Ed25519 public key>"
}
```

Private release signing keys must never be shipped in the repository, bootstrap, Desktop app or device image.

## Signed manifest

Prototype schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-manifest/1",
  "source_repository": "washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os",
  "source_commit": "<lowercase 40-hex commit>",
  "release_id": "<same commit in prototype>",
  "created_from_ci_recipe": "release/native/1",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "name": "system.tar",
      "role": "system",
      "url": "https://...",
      "sha256": "<lowercase 64-hex>",
      "size": 123
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent rejects unknown JSON fields, unsafe names, non-HTTPS artifact URLs, repository mismatch, malformed commits/hashes, duplicate artifact names and oversized documents/artifacts.

## Agent

`main.go` uses only the Go standard library:

- `crypto/ed25519` for manifest authenticity;
- `crypto/sha256` for artifact integrity;
- `net/http` for HTTPS acquisition;
- strict `encoding/json` decoding;
- filesystem staging, fsync, rename and symlink activation through `os`.

The CI pins Go 1.27.1, runs the protocol regression suite, builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`, rejects a dynamic program interpreter and publishes candidate hashes/provenance.

No candidate is automatically authorized for physical USB use.

## Creator payload boundary

The CI output is a candidate input to the OrdaX Creator payload; it is never a direct permission to write physical media.

The payload assembler copies the exact verified `ordax-release-agent` bytes into its bundle-relative release-agent location. The canonical media manifest then pins the SHA-256 of those copied bytes. Before a future physical `apply`, Creator Core hashes the assembled local file again and rejects any mismatch, traversal, symlink substitution or missing file.

```text
release-agent CI candidate
 -> verified candidate SHA-256 + provenance
 -> deterministic Creator payload
 -> bundle-relative source_path
 -> Creator Core local SHA-256 recheck
 -> disposable media proof
 -> explicit destructive authorization
 -> physical write
```

Temporary CI runner paths and workflow artifact IDs are evidence/provenance only; they are never runtime `source_path` values in the physical media contract.

## CLI

Verify a downloaded envelope without installing it:

```text
ordax-release-agent verify-envelope \
  --envelope release-envelope.json \
  --trust /ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json
```

Inspect the current signed channel without downloading its artifact or changing device state:

```text
ordax-release-agent inspect \
  --envelope-url https://releases.example/ordax/stable.json \
  --trust /ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json
```

`inspect` fetches only the release envelope, verifies its Ed25519 signature and strict manifest policy, and returns the signed source commit plus artifact metadata. It does **not** request `system.tar`, create a release directory or change `/ordax/current`.

Acquire and verify one exact commit without activating it:

```text
ordax-release-agent materialize \
  --envelope-url https://releases.example/ordax/stable.json \
  --trust /ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json \
  --root /ordax \
  --expected-commit <lowercase-40-hex>
```

This mode is used by the A/B base-update owner. It requires the signed `source_commit` to equal `--expected-commit`, writes only the immutable `/ordax/releases/<commit>` release, persists the exact verified signed envelope as `release-envelope.json` beside `release-manifest.json`, and leaves `/ordax/current` unchanged. Reuse of an existing release requires both persisted files to remain byte-identical to the freshly verified envelope and its signed payload.

Acquire and activate a release:

```text
ordax-release-agent install \
  --envelope-url https://releases.example/ordax/stable.json \
  --trust /ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json \
  --root /ordax
```

For the prototype, `release_id` equals `source_commit`, so immutable release identity and target directory are unambiguous.

See `docs/RELEASE-CHANNEL.md` for the system-wide delivery contract.


## Exact offline activation

A Stable/MVP update must not resolve `latest` again after staged health succeeds. The release agent therefore exposes an offline exact activation primitive:

```text
ordax-release-agent activate-exact \
  --root /ordax \
  --trust /ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json \
  --repository washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os \
  --expected-commit <40-hex-source-commit>
```

Before replacing `/ordax/current`, the command re-verifies the stored signed envelope, manifest, artifact hash/size and materialized system tree for the exact commit. It also requires the existing `current` pointer to name a safe bootable release and reports that previous commit for rollback.

The command performs no network access, no artifact download, no materialization and no reboot. Health-ready policy remains owned by `system/supervisor`; merely having this command available does not authorize automatic Stable activation.


## Portable USB v2 candidate materialization

The acquisition agent now recognizes `prototype-ordax.release-manifest/2` only for the exact portable identity:

```text
product_mode=usb
storage_profile=portable-usb-v2
runtime_format=erofs
artifact=system.erofs
role=system-image
```

The new command is intentionally separate:

```text
ordax-release-agent materialize-portable \
  --envelope-url <https-url> \
  --trust <release-trust.json> \
  --expected-commit <40-hex> \
  --root /ordax-data/.ordax
```

It verifies the signed envelope/manifest, exact SHA-256 and size, checks the EROFS superblock, writes into a temporary release directory, persists the signed manifest and envelope, re-verifies the staged bytes and atomically renames the complete directory to:

```text
/ordax-data/.ordax/releases/<commit>/
├─ system.erofs
├─ release-manifest.json
└─ release-envelope.json
```

This path deliberately **does not activate** the release and does not create the legacy `current` symlink. The old `materialize`, `install` and `activate-exact` paths remain v1-only. Portable v2 activation stays fail-closed until the dedicated initramfs/boot handoff and recovery model are implemented and proven.


Before any portable-v2 boot handoff, the already materialized release can be revalidated offline:

```text
ordax-release-agent verify-portable-exact \
  --trust <release-trust.json> \
  --expected-commit <40-hex> \
  --root /ordax-data/.ordax
```

This command performs no network access, does not modify the release, does not create an activation pointer and does not mount the image. It revalidates the stored signed envelope, manifest v2 identity, exact commit, artifact hash/size and EROFS superblock. The boot handoff must consume only a release that passes this exact verification.


## Portable USB v3 runtime materialization

`release-manifest/3` adds the offline graphical Surface runtime as a second signed artifact without changing the v2 meaning.

Canonical signed artifacts:

```text
1. system.erofs                  role=system-image
2. native-surface-runtime.erofs  role=surface-runtime
```

Acquire one exact v3 release:

```text
ordax-release-agent materialize-portable-v3 \
  --envelope-url <https-url> \
  --trust <release-trust.json> \
  --expected-commit <40-hex> \
  --root /ordax-data/.ordax
```

The system image remains release-addressed by source commit. The larger graphical runtime is content-addressed by the signed SHA-256 so identical runtime bytes can be reused across later system releases:

```text
/ordax-data/.ordax/releases/<commit>/
├─ system.erofs
├─ surface-runtime.sha256
├─ release-manifest.json
└─ release-envelope.json

/ordax-data/.ordax/runtimes/sha256/<runtime_sha256>/
└─ native-surface-runtime.erofs
```

Before reuse, the agent rechecks the stored runtime size, SHA-256 and EROFS superblock. A hash match therefore avoids a network download but does not bypass verification.

Offline revalidation is explicit:

```text
ordax-release-agent verify-portable-v3-exact \
  --trust <release-trust.json> \
  --expected-commit <40-hex> \
  --root /ordax-data/.ordax
```

Both v3 commands are non-activating. They do not create `current`, do not perform a boot handoff and do not authorize physical USB writing or publication.

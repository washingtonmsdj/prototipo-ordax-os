# Bootstrap Release Channel Configuration

Status: CANONICAL PROTOTYPE INPUT — PHYSICAL USE STILL NOT AUTHORIZED

This owner contains the minimum bootstrap configuration needed to locate the first signed OrdaX release envelope.

Canonical source file:

```text
bootstrap/config/release-envelope-url
```

Canonical runtime path:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/config/release-envelope-url
```

The file contains exactly one HTTPS URL:

```text
https://github.com/washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os/releases/latest/download/release-envelope.json
```

GitHub documents `/releases/latest/download/<asset>` as the direct download form for an asset on the latest release. This pointer selects the candidate delivery object only; it is **not** an authenticity authority. The downloaded envelope must still pass the local Ed25519 trust anchor, strict schema checks, repository pin, exact source-commit identity, artifact size checks and SHA-256 verification.

## Security boundary

- HTTPS is mandatory transport;
- the `latest` pointer may move only by publishing another GitHub Release;
- moving that pointer cannot make an unsigned or wrongly signed envelope acceptable;
- the release trust anchor remains independently pinned in `/ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json`;
- changing this URL is a source-controlled bootstrap policy change;
- no access token, credential or private signing material belongs in this file;
- physical write remains blocked while the release trust owner is unresolved and until the remaining promotion gates pass.


## Optional account gateway configuration

Stable/MVP may also provide:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/config/account-gateway-origin
```

This file is optional because the OS must remain usable offline and without an
OrdaX account. When present, it contains exactly one HTTPS origin, for example:

```text
https://accounts.example.invalid
```

The bootstrap validates that it is an HTTPS origin without path, query,
fragment, credentials or whitespace before exporting
`ORDAX_ACCOUNT_GATEWAY_ORIGIN` to the verified product runtime. The Native
Surface then talks only to its loopback host; the host forwards `/auth/*` and
`/sync/*` to this configured OrdaX gateway while keeping provider/session
cookies outside Surface JavaScript.

Absence or rejection of this file disables online account continuity only. It
must never block local boot, OOBE completion, files, notes, settings, recovery
or local Intelligence. No Supabase URL, service-role key, user token or other
provider credential belongs in this bootstrap file.

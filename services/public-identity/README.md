# OrdaX Public Identity Gateway

Status: GATEWAY CORE IMPLEMENTED / PROVIDER NOT CONFIGURED

This directory defines the backend responsibility that will sit behind the public site's login and registration entry points.

It is intentionally separate from:

- `sites/public/`, which is static presentation;
- `system/services/account/`, which owns product-side account semantics;
- any specific identity vendor.

## Intended flow

```text
sites/public/login or cadastro
 -> same-origin /auth/* entry
 -> OrdaX public identity gateway
 -> provider adapter
 -> canonical OrdaX account/session
```

The public page must not become the identity authority. The gateway owns provider handoff, callback validation, session establishment, logout and account bootstrap.

## Required routes

The gateway core in `gateway.py` now exposes this contract:

```text
GET  /auth/login
GET  /auth/register
GET  /auth/callback
POST /auth/logout
GET  /auth/session
```

The exact deployment host is deliberately not fixed here. `gateway.py` provides a dependency-free WSGI entrypoint and deliberately owns no public listener. Until a provider and same-origin deployment are configured, `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/callback` and `/auth/logout` fail closed with HTTP 503; `/auth/session` reports an anonymous, unauthenticated session.

The public site configuration therefore keeps login/register disabled until these routes are deployed behind the same origin. The runtime shape is pinned in `docs/contracts/public-identity-gateway.json`.

## Session policy

Production sessions must:

- use secure transport;
- prefer HttpOnly cookies so browser JavaScript does not own bearer tokens;
- use Secure cookies in production;
- use SameSite=Lax by default unless a reviewed flow requires otherwise;
- validate callback state/PKCE data;
- support revocation;
- avoid placing tokens in URLs, logs or analytics.

## Provider independence

A provider adapter may initially use Supabase Auth, but public routes and account semantics must remain OrdaX-owned.

The provider may not redefine:

- one-account-across-product-modes;
- entitlements;
- sync data classification;
- device/session revocation semantics;
- account deletion/export rules.

## Current provider decision

The previously suggested shared Supabase project was inspected read-only and is not a clean target for OrdaX identity: it already owns `auth.users` signup behavior and an unrelated `public.profiles` lifecycle.

No database, auth or Edge Function mutation was made there.

For Supabase, OrdaX identity therefore requires either a dedicated project or a development branch/project that passes the preflight in `infra/supabase/identity/preflight.sql`. Creating a paid branch/project remains a separate explicit action.

The provider-specific email/password HTTP adapter is implemented in `supabase_password.py`. It uses only a Supabase `sb_publishable_` key and the public Auth API for signup, password sign-in, refresh, current-user lookup and sign-out. It does not own cookies or public routes and is not instantiated by the gateway while the canonical provider remains unconfigured. Passwords are transient request inputs and are never written by the adapter.

Activation remains deliberately separate from implementation: a clean Supabase target must pass the read-only preflight, `0001_ordax_profiles.sql` must be applied there, the same-origin deployment/session owner must be connected, and the public legal-readiness gate must be complete before credential collection is exposed.

## Non-goals of this foundation

- no production identity provider is enabled;
- no password form is added to the static site;
- no publishable/service key is committed;
- no migration is applied to an existing Supabase project;
- no account is claimed to exist until the provider and gateway are live.

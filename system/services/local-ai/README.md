# OrdaX Local AI

Local AI is the default **AI Runtime / Inference Broker** for Stable/MVP. It is part of the target distribution, but it is never a boot dependency.

The backend boundary is `ordax.local-ai/1`. Product surfaces do **not** own this backend and should consume `ordax.intelligence/1` through the OrdaX Intelligence service. The inference backend must not leak llama.cpp, OpenVINO, a specific model vendor, or a cloud API into product semantics.

## Initial implementation direction

The first runtime target is `llama.cpp` with a small GGUF model. The current
candidate is Qwen3.5-0.8B-class so the first MVP does not assume a discrete GPU.
No engine/model bytes are accepted into a release until their exact SHA-256,
size, upstream source and license are pinned in the signed Stable release artifact contract.

The service listens on loopback only. Prompt content stays local by default.
There is no implicit cloud fallback, filesystem access, tool execution or
prompt telemetry.

## Migration

Engine and model identities are separate. A future release may replace
llama.cpp with OpenVINO or another local provider, and may replace the model,
without changing the Surface contract or user-facing assistant identity.

The model is stored outside `system.erofs` in a separate content-addressed `local-ai-runtime.erofs`, not inside `system.erofs`, so its engine/model bytes can evolve without bloating or redefining the shared system image. Stable/MVP product policy still requires a verified local inference payload to be included; independent updateability does not make the capability an optional product feature.

## Creator and delivery

Stable/MVP Creator does not expose an option to omit system Intelligence. Once the signed engine/model bundle is promoted, it is materialized as part of the product payload. Users may later change or upgrade a model/engine through a governed update path, but that is different from shipping a product without its Intelligence layer.

The real runtime is reproducibly proven in CI and the Portable v2 boot handoff now supports exact release-manifest v4 verification, read-only mounting under `/run/ordax/runtime/local-ai`, and loopback backend startup. Local-AI mount/start failure degrades Intelligence and does not block the operating system. This source-complete handoff still does not prove that a signed Stable v4 has been materially promoted or placed on a physical USB; signed Stable materialization, disposable v4 boot proof and real-hardware proof remain release gates. No boot path silently downloads the model.

# Current State

## Canonical Web presentation cutover — 2026-10-10

The approved workspace presentation lives under system/surface/workspace and
uses the official Web build. One composition, one root dependency lock and
shared symbol/font sources remain, with no evaluation route or redirect.
Pending app interfaces are preserved. Real service wiring is the next phase:
presentation asserts no authenticated session, user files, inference, sync,
package installation or remote-device access. Native operational UI, services,
contracts and public Account are preserved. See docs/DESKTOP-IDENTITY.md and
migration ledger 007. This is a source/candidate change, not production activation.



## Canonical v4 — assinatura offline verificada, ainda não publicada (2026-10-10)

O candidato v4 com origem congelada em `6128e2c` passou nos três builds de
operador (sistema, Surface e IA local), com artefatos de 14 dias e validação
real dos IDs/recibos pela API do GitHub. A montagem **não assinada**
(run `38031520848`) foi aprovada. O runbook local de assinatura Ed25519
produziu um envelope que passou em **dois verificadores canônicos** e cujo
payload corresponde byte a byte ao manifesto v4. A chave privada permaneceu
fora do repositório e do pacote. Evidência objetiva:
`docs/evidence/canonical-v4-offline-signing-2026-10-10.md`.

**Não confundir com release pronta:** o envelope ainda não foi publicado,
os três EROFS não foram materializados/verificados juntos no destino e não
houve nova prova v4 de release publicada nem boot atual de USB. O Windows
possui somente disco interno com ~5,2 GiB livres em C:, insuficiente como
área de trabalho confortável para cópias grandes; nenhuma gravação física
foi autorizada ou executada. O gate jurídico é independente deste caminho.


## Development vs. public legal attestation — 2026-10-10

The canonical `MVP.md` and
`docs/contracts/public-legal-readiness.json` now distinguish **source
development and integration** from **publication of an online Account flow**.
The public-site candidate and all OS/USB/Native/Apps/Studio/Runtime builds do
not require live legal-policy attestation to proceed. The separate
`public-legal-integrity` workflow still runs strict production attestation on
its schedule or when manually requested. The active policy's published HTML
digest mismatch remains a **public signup/release** issue, not a gate on
source/CI or offline USB development. See `docs/PUBLIC-LEGAL-READINESS.md`.

The identity entry contract no longer carries the retired
`supabase_candidate` project: its sole provider destination owner is
`infra/supabase/product/account_destination_migration_plan.json`
(`ordax-platform`). Runtime policy state is verified live; three stale
source-level false values for policy activation/visibility were removed.
This changes **no authentication credentials, tables, real user records,
legal receipts or public-account activation flags**.


## Public deployment proof — 2026-10-10

`ordax.com.br` serves the public portal deployed from `7d5b4d4` (production
Vercel deployment `dpl_GFtqgXd9TTbfz7QeDN5eh3i9vK7J`, `READY`) with the
verified account dashboard visual fixes and browser-side registration digest
gate. The delivered `/assets/site.js` was independently fetched over HTTPS
and confirmed to include the SHA-256 check for both published legal pages.
Anonymous HTTPS proof uses the shared SSOT state machine with four
explicit states: `gated`, `disabled-unconfigured`, `auth-only`, and `full`. The observed production state
is **`auth-only`**: a real anonymous Supabase-backed session and active
registration policy are reachable through same-origin, while full public
Account activation, cloud sync and password recovery remain **unavailable**.
The public config explicitly keeps `account_activation_ready=false` and
`auth_only_source_enabled=true`. A denied, unchallenged recovery POST is not an
end-to-end recovery proof. Current legal policy in canonical Supabase is active
(version `2026.10.09`); older policy readiness booleans require owner-level
reconciliation. **Legal integrity remains a blocking production defect**:
server-owned active document digests for both legal pages differ from the
published HTML; the strengthened deployment proof now fails closed. See
`docs/evidence/public-legal-integrity-2026-10-10.md` for sanitized hashes,
record counts and the non-destructive remediation path. The browser registration
form now also checks the exact published HTML of both policy documents using
SHA-256 before exposing the consent/submit controls; login is not coupled to
this check. This is defense in depth, **not** a replacement for server policy
reconciliation. No credentialed E2E,
USB physical proof, signed Creator publisher or public Stable release has
been established by this site proof.

## USB source ownership reconciliation — 2026-10-10

`docs/contracts/physical-write-authorization.json` now names the canonical
`ordaxsystems/ordax-os` repository rather than the historical pre-transfer
owner. The previous canonical-v4 release envelope URL remains unchanged as
historical signed provenance. This is **metadata reconciliation only**:
`physical_write_allowed=false`, `explicit_owner_authorization=false`,
`authorization_context_sha256=null`, and
`canonical_v4_release_proof_bound=false` still apply. The read-only operator
checker remains `blocked`, with unresolved release bindings and physical
consent; public Creator Authenticode identity/custody is still unconfigured.
No USB media was attached to the tested Windows host; no disk write occurred.


## Public account and Web entry — 2026-10-09 source candidate

The public portal now has a responsive My account overview at `/conta/` and a
separate `/web/` entry.

The account concept now uses the user-approved transparent ribbon, OS landscape and Inter through
the canonical brand build. Symbol presentation is now shared with all public headers
through the single Surface `brand/symbol.css` owner; legacy CSS drawings are removed. It includes responsive service sections, search,
deep links, keyboard focus and mobile navigation. Plan names are derived from
entitlements; locale uses the existing portal owner. These are presentation
capabilities, not activation of billing, profile editing or device control.
The overview now follows the approved compact desktop/mobile viewport composition;
session controls use a native disclosure and mobile search opens on demand.
The existing isolated browser gate verifies five actual viewports and keyboard
interaction in Public Site CI, with rendered screenshots retained as evidence.

Account data comes only from the existing verified
same-origin session; native sign-out remains unchanged. Back navigation clears
personal data and launch links before revalidation. Plans/storage/devices show
availability without fabricated usage, permissions or assigned subscription.
Web launch requires verified identity and a configured, owner-approved product
destination. Configuration and contract keep the actual Web runtime disabled;
no hosted Surface, public identity activation or live account E2E is implied.
See `docs/PUBLIC-SITE.md` for ownership, acceptance and remaining gates.

## Studio Web availability — 2026-10-09 source candidate

The shared rail now opens the existing Studio host integration panel. The panel distinguishes read discovery from an operational workspace, suppresses misleading zero capability metrics when the reader is absent, delegates Projects to its existing app owner and links to the public ChatGPT site with explicit mode/quota guidance. The full portable conversation/preview source belongs to `ordaxsystems/ordax-apps` and is **not yet composed into OS Web**. The bundled `system/apps/studio` version identifies the legacy integration component, not the current canonical portable product version. No external payload, provider session, Runtime execution or production installation has been activated. See [STUDIO-WEB-AVAILABILITY.md](STUDIO-WEB-AVAILABILITY.md).


## Surface visual identity — 2026-10-09 source candidate

Midnight (dark) and Ice (light) implement the approved ribbon/blue-violet visual direction in the shared Surface tokens/composition. The approved transparent ribbon PNG and its canonical presentation stylesheet are shared by the shell, loading screen and public headers; the generated landscape is a local offline asset with recorded provenance. Navigation, command search, Home shortcuts and the floating dock retain canonical state owners; Settings previews use the same tokens and the existing `appearance.theme` owner. Light remains the default, and preference persistence, accessibility and account-sync authority are unchanged. See [DESKTOP-IDENTITY.md](DESKTOP-IDENTITY.md) for scope, acceptance and ownership. This source candidate does not activate a production release or establish physical-media evidence.

Status date: 2026-09-30

This is the canonical handoff snapshot. Architecture/contracts win if another document conflicts with it. Detailed historical evidence remains under `docs/evidence/`; this file records the current boundary without treating CI proof, development-hardware proof and product-release authorization as interchangeable. Values that mirror structured source — including product/app versions, component release modes and physical-media geometry — are regression-checked against their owners so this snapshot cannot silently drift from the implementation.

## First-party utility Store policies (2026-10-08)

The first-party delivery policy additionally recognizes twelve optional utility app IDs from `ordaxsystems/ordax-apps` as `on-demand/store-only`. This is **metadata/presentation policy only**: a future verified signed catalog may project them, but no app becomes installed, launchable or production-installable from metadata alone. Initial USB MVP scope and on-demand boot policy remain unchanged; Native Store lifecycle executor and public Store UI remain disabled until separate trust, lifecycle and release gates are proven. The source, G0 package inventory and public App SDK contracts retain their respective canonical owners.

## Autoridade de repositório (reconciliada em 2026-10-09)

O bloco `## Repository` abaixo reflete agora o owner canônico real, conforme
`docs/contracts/repository-ownership.json` e `docs/contracts/repository-migration-status.json`.
A linha `Status date` no início identifica a data do snapshot histórico geral:
não certifica, sozinha, todas as demais capacidades ali descritas como atuais.
Os antigos slugs `washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os` e
`ordaxsystems/prototipo-ordax-os` permanecem válidos exclusivamente como
proveniência da transferência/renomeação, não como autoridade operacional.
Uma Stable pública assinada não é inferida do nome final do repositório;
seus gates de publicação e hardware continuam independentes.

The canonical prototype trust ceremony and public handoff are complete. The eligible toolkit bound to `2172eb6a18430910afd036199ec492ad63dc185d` passed read-only preflight; canonical Ed25519 key material was generated locally, independent public derivation matched, the proof signature passed, recovery was verified from a distinct restored copy, and the recovered signing envelope passed public verification. The exact public anchor is pinned in Git and the minimal-bootstrap trust binding remains resolved. An earlier owner authorization existed for the first Stable/MVP USB proof, release sequence 1, but it was bound to a previous physical-writer context and is no longer valid after the writer changed. On 2026-09-26 the owner-controlled v4 candidate was signed and published as a prerelease, then materialized and verified from its exact versioned HTTPS URL in CI run `36234573905`; aggregate proof SHA-256 `2dd17580ddbf5a0fd0433a912e97e6bded04fd0a44ea0849e9da15e13df01e4b` is bound in the repository. This prerelease did not become GitHub's stable `latest` release. The authorization contract is now `blocked-explicit-physical-authorization-pending`, with `physical_write_allowed=false`, `explicit_owner_authorization=false` and no authorization-context hash. A fresh explicit owner authorization must be recorded against the current writer context before any destructive physical flow becomes eligible. No target-specific consent has been recorded and no USB is selected or authorized for a new write; live target revalidation, Windows UAC and target-specific destructive confirmation remain separate later gates. The local PEM remains a controlled prototype signing backend rather than the intended long-term production custody model; independent off-device custody and managed non-exportable KMS/HSM remain broad-distribution hardening requirements, with signed trust rotation required before broad public distribution.

The first formal human product version is **OrdaX Prototype v0.1.0**. Product version, Entrega, Git SHA and component/app versions are separate identities: v0.1.0 identifies the prototype product milestone, Entrega identifies the notebook-facing delivery sequence, the SHA remains the exact technical build identity, and each component may evolve its own SemVer. First-party apps on the `0.x` line are **Beta**; `1.0.0` remains reserved for the first stable release of each app. Internet is currently `0.3.0 Beta` and Projetos is `0.1.0 Beta`; both use `git-app` in Owner/Development. Notes remains a known first-party product identity but its local payload is intentionally absent during the pre-launch externalization gate. Arquivos, Ajustes, Conta and Sistema are `0.1.0 Beta` and remain `bundled`. A component having its own version does not mean it already has a production-independent update channel: `git-app` is a development delivery mode, while production-independent activation remains gated behind the signed `component-slot` path with pending health, promotion and rollback. Product v1.0 remains reserved for the stable product rather than being inferred from prototype maturity, component versions or delivery count.

`system/` is the shared product source. The native development path is physically proven through `system/entrypoint (guardian) -> system/supervisor -> system/surface/entrypoint -> system/surface/bin/ordax-surface`; repository CI also proves that the actual `system/` tree can be bundled deterministically as `system.tar`.

The shared graphical source remains under `system/surface/ui/` with platform-neutral contracts, workspace/window lifecycle and capability-driven app availability. Projects is a first-party application with stable app id `projects`, version `0.1.0 Beta` and `git-app` delivery in Owner/Development. It consumes the existing neutral local project catalog and optional `ordax.project-cloud-links-reader/1` read-only overlay over `ordax.project-cloud-links/1` data; it does not create a second project store, require an account, upload local files by default or change local project identity. Web currently degrades honestly when no local/cloud project catalog is supplied. Notes remains a known first-party product with stable app id `notes`, classified as `on-demand` and `store-only`. During the pre-launch remove-first externalization gate its payload is intentionally absent from `system/`: there is no local Notes runtime, fixed launcher path, app-owned localization payload or legacy `/__ordax/native/notes` persistence endpoint. Its future package is sourced from `ordax-apps` and will consume public platform contracts such as `ordax.app-data/1`, `ordax.intelligence/1` and `ordax.file-space/11`. The Store is discovery/request UI only; its authority-free lifecycle request contract now models install, update and remove while refusing artifact/version selection, trust changes, permission grants, verification bypass and implicit user-data deletion. Verified acquisition, install/update staging, health, promotion, rollback, uninstall execution and inventory remain platform lifecycle authority, and the Native executor stays unmounted while canonical component trust/publication/activation gates remain closed. Internet is the first-party browser app with stable id `internet`, version `0.3.0 Beta` and `git-app` delivery in Owner/Development; this version identity does not claim a production Store/updater. Its shared Surface owns the approved concept structure (navigation toolbar, workspace/tab rail, central web viewport and project-context panel), while Native/USB provide `browser.web-content` through a separate unprivileged WebKit context and one external WebView per tab. The native slice supports up to 16 tabs, back/forward/reload, tab search, keyboard accelerators, persisted public tab URLs/order/active tab, project-context selection, explicit saved web references with bounded per-reference notes, automatic reference cleanup after project removal, public-network filtering and an exact loopback Host/browser-provenance boundary. Saved project references are owned by a neutral project-domain runtime and persist in the Native privileged profile with honest session fallback; the external page never receives project storage capability. Web intentionally exposes an unavailable browser-session port rather than pretending arbitrary sites can be safely embedded. Notes web references activate this same `internet` app. Internet also owns bounded device-local favorites through a neutral `ordax.browser-favorites/1` port; the Native privileged profile persists them while external website WebViews receive no access to that store. Native hardware proof for the new WebKit host remains pending, so the browser slice is implemented in source but not yet marked physically proven. Ajustes now owns persisted Surface-level contrast, motion and text-scale preferences; text scale changes the shared typographic base without claiming host-level accessibility control. Platform-specific behavior belongs in adapters/compositions, not in forks of the shared Surface. The normal Home now keeps technical delivery/recovery markers out of the area label; real delivery identity and update details live in Sistema. The visible settings identity is standardized as **Ajustes** while preserving the stable internal app id `settings`.

### Nova OrdaX pre-USB functional closure

The legacy/product-vision audit has been revalidated before the first Stable/MVP
physical USB. `PLANO-03-FECHAMENTO-PRE-USB-NOVA-ORDAX.md` is now the active
pre-USB closure plan. Physical media work is intentionally held while the remaining
class-A product gaps are closed. Ordax Intelligence consumers, Native local
session/lock, safe Files removal and PT-BR/en-US launch-language coverage are now
source-complete. The historical v4 candidate carrying the proven local-AI runtime was
signed, materialized, exactly verified and bound by a non-activating proof at source
`b924ff8d74d1761232381ae3f9604bba17497cfd`. It remains a public prerelease and valid
historical pre-hardening evidence, but PR #588 and later source hardening superseded it
for current-main physical promotion. The stable `latest` channel has not been promoted.
Diagnostics/recovery presentation and the conservative MVP hardware-support matrix
are source-complete; their target-hardware/physical proofs remain later gates.

The v4 Creator payload change deliberately revoked the stale 15-artifact authorization
context instead of widening it. The structured physical-authorization contract is now
authoritative at `blocked-canonical-v4-release-proof-pending`: the historical
`canonical-v4-release-proof.json` cannot be rebound to reopen consent. A replacement
signed/materialized v4 proof from a different post-hardening source commit must be
produced, verified and bound before owner consent becomes reachable. The 17-artifact
writer remains fail-closed, no USB target is selected, no target-specific destructive
confirmation is current and no new physical write/proof is authorized. The physical Creator
now keeps writer/tooling provenance separate from release identity: the writer embeds its own
Git SHA as provenance plus the canonical v4 release source commit from
`physical-write-authorization.json -> release_binding.source_commit`. Target-specific
Portable media/application plans must use that canonical release commit, and
`prepare-portable`/`apply-portable` fail closed unless it matches; the v4 writer accepts
exactly 17 canonical artifact sources, never the previous 15-source shape.

### Pre-MVP ecosystem foundation

A separate product-domain foundation is now defined before public accounts carry real data. The account model distinguishes one OrdaX identity from **Spaces** and versioned **Profile Packs**; the initial Developer and Legal-BR packs are draft descriptors only and do not activate professional-domain behavior. Billing, prices and commercial tier names remain undefined. A provisional two-private-Space default exists only as an internal capacity foundation and is not a public commercial claim.

Persistent Intelligence memory is now implemented as OrdaX-owned through `ordax.memory/1`, with explicit `device|account` ownership, device/account/space/project/session scopes, provenance, bounded search/review/edit/delete semantics and durable `flush()` confirmation. Native/USB owns a bounded private atomic memory state through a loopback-only endpoint and mounts the memory runtime fail-soft; Web fallback is explicitly ephemeral and cannot pretend durable device/account/Space/project state. Account → Memory now mounts a user-visible Native review surface over the same owner-scoped runtime, with device/account owner switching, bounded search/pagination, editing, deletion and durable flush feedback; the Web composition deliberately shows durable memory as unavailable instead of simulating persistence. `ordax.memory-context-auth/1` and the authorized-memory bridge require composition-layer authorization before any memory reaches Intelligence, and ordinary Intelligence requests still inject no memory automatically unless Native composition has an explicit identity-bound `Space em uso`; Native composition now explicitly authorizes a shared bounded Memory set: device scope always remains available locally, authenticated account scope is added only for the real signed-in `subjectId`, and selected-Space scope is added only for that same subject plus exact `spaceId`; project/session/restricted memory is not inferred. in that case only account-owned, non-restricted `scope=space` memory for that exact `subjectId + spaceId` is eligible as selected Space Memory context. `ordax.model-router/1` is now active in the Intelligence runtime, binds local routes to `engineId + modelId` and keeps future OpenAI/xAI routes fail-closed without explicit egress plus an enabled adapter. Local AI remains the offline baseline and no inference provider owns persistent memory.

The dedicated Supabase project `ordax-control-plane` is the selected pre-MVP backend target for the product schema. The source-controlled migrations under `infra/supabase/product/` have been applied: `ordax_accounts`, Spaces/membership, server-authoritative entitlement grants, versioned Profile Packs, memory metadata + pgvector embeddings and project-connection metadata all use RLS. The older duplicate `ordax_profiles` migration was removed so Auth has one OrdaX product bootstrap owner. The Supabase password provider is implemented and the OrdaX account gateway is deployed to the dedicated control-plane backend. Sign-in, sign-up implementation, refresh, validated session state and logout use HttpOnly cookies and never expose provider tokens to Surface JavaScript. Account registration itself is now explicitly fail-closed across Surface capability, Native host and gateway until a reviewed legal policy plus server-authoritative document-version receipt binding exists; login remains independent. Account sync now uses an atomic initial snapshot plus a subject-bound persisted incremental cursor for appearance, portable preferences and workspace metadata on Web and Native/USB. **Public browser login remains fail-closed** pending the same-origin production hosting boundary, leaked-password protection, remaining Auth hardening and legal readiness. The Account Surface now also has a minimal read-only Spaces view on Web and Native/USB: it consumes only `/account/spaces`, validates a bounded provider-neutral projection, clears cached Space data on sign-out and never invents a local Space. The account gateway source v17 is deployed as Edge Function revision 27; registration remains explicitly disabled. The live gateway also enforces the shared server-authoritative auth rate limit on direct Native credential/recovery paths and keeps password-recovery credentials isolated from normal account sessions. A service-role-only read projection now exposes only the active/effective canonical Privacy/Terms metadata through `/auth/registration-policy`; Web and Native source consume that same projection, intersect it with their local registration gate, and require affirmative acceptance without trusting client-supplied version/hash authority. The server-authoritative registration legal receipt migration `20261002221427_account_registration_legal_receipt_v1` is applied: the existing single `auth.users` trigger now requires a short-lived service-issued legal intent, binds it to the normalized-email SHA-256 and active canonical legal policy, snapshots Privacy/Terms version + effective date + SHA-256 into a private receipt in the same user-creation transaction, and rejects direct signup bypasses. No active legal policy exists yet, so the source-ready Web/Native acceptance UI remains unavailable and public registration stays fail-closed; the dedicated account lifecycle service is deployed as revision 2 with global session revocation before account deletion while account-close remains disabled. Public browser account access and account-close execution remain disabled.

OrdaX Network now has a live server-authoritative MVP backend in the same
`ordax-control-plane`. The six v1 Network migrations plus all six canonical v2
mutation migrations are applied: message-send, direct-create, block-change,
group-join, report-create and group-create. Public v2 wrappers remain
`SECURITY INVOKER`; privileged implementations remain private
`SECURITY DEFINER` with `search_path=''`. The live schema exposes zero direct
Network table grants to `anon` or `authenticated`. Group/report idempotency
columns are nullable for legacy v1 rows and protected by partial unique indexes
for v2 retries. The multi-tenant PostgreSQL proof covers cross-account denial,
viewer write denial, block behavior, idempotency, rate-limit durability, group
lifecycle and deletion/tombstone behavior. The first-party Network app exists
as an optional fail-soft component and pins a draft to its sender Space; a
global Space change never silently retargets the pending draft. The same-origin
message route is deployed through Native -> account gateway -> Edge ->
`ordax_network_send_message_v2`, while `PUBLIC_SITE_NETWORK_ENABLED=false`
keeps public Network activation fail-closed.

First-party Product OAuth now has a separate persistent authorization domain from
owner/development MCP credentials. The private OAuth client/code/grant/access-token
authority is applied in `ordax-control-plane`; authorization code + PKCE S256,
single-use code consumption, opaque access-token resolution/revocation and current
Space authority are proven end to end through the provider-neutral HTTP boundary.
The canonical Achegue-se client `acheguese-web-01` remains deliberately
`disabled` with an empty redirect allowlist and exactly the three initial read
scopes. A read-only Product Network resource server is also applied: its server-only
RPCs accept only SHA-256 access-token digests, revalidate token/grant/client/scope
and current owner/admin authority, and expose bound Space, discoverable directory
and active communities reads. Public RPC EXECUTE is limited to `service_role`;
`anon` and `authenticated` have no Product Network resource RPC authority.
No public listener, real redirect or Achegue-se linking is enabled.

A Product MCP boundary is also specified separately from the owner/development Control Plane. Future ChatGPT/Grok clients authenticate to OrdaX OAuth, then receive only account/Space/project-scoped tools. GitHub is a separate connection, preferably through a GitHub App restricted to selected repositories; upstream GitHub credentials are never returned to the external model. Public Product MCP deployment, mutating tools, connectors and automations remain post-MVP functionality.

This foundation does not change the current physical release gate:

### System diagnostics and recovery presentation

Sistema now composes the existing Native diagnostic-review owner instead of passing a
null controller. The review remains explicit, local and sanitized, and can copy/export
only through the existing bounded adapters.

A separate `ordax.recovery-status/1` observer exposes factual Portable v2 state:
running slot/source, current, known-good, candidate/activation transaction and the
actual recovery loader entry on ORDAX-ESP. The recovery entry is not accepted by
presence alone; the observer checks the expected kernel/initramfs/portable-init and
`ordax.mode=recovery` markers. This port is intentionally read-only and exposes no
rollback, reboot, repair, network or mutation authority.

The MVP hardware support matrix is also now canonical in source. It explicitly says
that driver presence is not a support claim and that canonical Stable target hardware
still requires physical proof.

```

### Shared Surface localization

The Surface now owns `ordax.localization/1`, derived from the existing persisted
`regional.locale` preference rather than a second locale state. The shell is
created in the selected locale on its first frame and re-renders localized shell
copy without rebuilding windows or losing interaction state. English entries now
cover the shared shell, launcher, workspace/window chrome, connectivity labels and
first-party app metadata. Unsupported message IDs fail closed; locales without a
shared translation fall back to PT-BR source copy explicitly.

English is now marked as a complete Surface locale for the public MVP. Files covers its
primary navigation/search/list/selection/Recents/Trash journey, common forms, deep operational
feedback, locale-aware sorting, import/export, copy/move/rename/create-folder flows, preview and
Files → Notes presentation through the shared catalog.
Settings/System cover their section navigation/header copy, and System now also derives
its overview health/summary, memory and user-storage resource views, update transaction details/history, component/update scopes, About/versioning, capability inventory, Intelligence presentation, and the explicit sanitized diagnostic review from structured runtime state through the shared
localization owner. Runtime failure banners in these System flows now retain semantic message IDs and translate at render time, so changing locale does not preserve stale rendered PT-BR copy. Settings now also covers Appearance, Accessibility, Regional preferences,
physical keyboard layout and deep Network/Wi-Fi presentation in PT-BR/en-US through that same owner;
async keyboard/Wi-Fi feedback stores semantic message IDs rather than rendered copy, and Wi-Fi
credentials remain transient interaction state. Settings covers its Notifications policy/source and local-session
Security sections end to end, and the Native live session lock rerenders through the same
localization owner while keeping
the entered secret only in transient repaint memory. Account covers its complete
first-party overview/sync experience in English. Notes now covers its
primary navigation/editor shell, project/list states, core persistence copy,
locale-aware relative time, image/file-picker/checklist/reference flows, capacity/statistics,
prompts/confirmations and consultative Intelligence controls. Its picker/runtime failures retain
semantic message IDs and newly attached local-file metadata no longer persists translated system
labels. Internet now covers its primary browser shell,
locale-aware tab/address search, project context, home status, project references,
favorites/history and first-party operational feedback deeply in PT-BR/en-US. Its own
feedback is stored as semantic message identity so a live locale change does not preserve
stale rendered copy. The shared Home continuation/pending cards, power controls,
global update accelerator, desktop-clock fallback and Surface boot screen also use the shared
localization owner; first-party async feedback retains semantic message identity across live locale
changes. Network and battery tray/quick-panel presentation plus the Notification Center use
`ordax.localization/1` and rerender on locale changes. `ordax.notifications/3` keeps
backward-compatible text fallbacks while first-party update events persist bounded semantic
presentation identity, allowing stored update history to rerender in the active locale without
heuristic text translation. The public MVP selectors expose only PT-BR and en-US. Spanish, German
and French remain OOBE-complete compatibility/future-rollout locales and are not advertised as
complete Surface languages.

### Files safe removal

The Native Files owner now exposes `ordax.file-space/11` with recoverable
`trashEntry()`, `listTrash()` and `restoreTrashEntry()`. The trash payload and
metadata live in a private reserved namespace under the user root that is not valid
as a public logical file-space path. Same-filesystem removal uses no-clobber rename;
restore also uses no-clobber and refuses to overwrite a new item at the original
path. Cross-device trash is rejected rather than converted into an unsafe delete,
and symlinks remain outside the supported boundary. Recent-file references are
cleared when their item is trashed, while Project continuity is invalidated only
after the file operation succeeds. Permanent delete and empty-trash actions are not
part of this MVP flow.

### Ordax Intelligence and local inference

The canonical Memory-to-Intelligence composition now guards account/Space
continuity throughout asynchronous inference. Account changes, logout and Space
changes discard a pending response even after returning to the original context;
changes during Memory retrieval block inference. Independent requests release
their observers, and disposed Intelligence rejects an in-flight completion.
The existing Memory, Model Router and Local AI ports remain the only authorities.
Regression evidence: 388 Node tests from Intelligence Foundation and its existing
consumer chain pass locally, including deferred account/Space races. The pipeline
test uses the real Intelligence/router with a deferred test backend; it is not a
physical model run or a remote Studio/plugin integration. Public plugin transport,
client/device grants and context/egress authorization remain separate gates.

Ordax Intelligence is now a first-class system service with stable contract `ordax.intelligence/1`; an Assistant UI is only a possible client. The Native composition now creates the provider-neutral `ordax.local-ai/1 -> ordax.intelligence/1` chain and exposes real consultative first-party consumers: Notes can request a bounded provenance-bearing summary without rewriting the note, and System can request an explanation using only local Surface capabilities/connectivity plus sanitized metrics. Neither consumer imports llama.cpp/Qwen directly, and both retain `authority=none` with tool execution disabled. The service therefore exists as a real system function in source rather than only a model/runtime test. The Stable v4 source handoff is now implemented: Portable v2 verifies `release-manifest/4`, resolves and mounts the content-addressed `local-ai-runtime.erofs` read-only, and Stable Base starts the loopback backend when the verified runtime is available. Intelligence/model failure remains non-boot-critical and degrades the capability instead of blocking boot, Surface, recovery, files or updates. Disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 boot and fallback are now PASS_CI; canonical Stable v4 signing/materialization and the later physical Stable/MVP proof remain separate release gates.

The initial source lock pins Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q4_0 by exact GGUF SHA-256/size and llama.cpp by exact source commit plus the reproducibly observed `llama-server` ELF SHA-256/size. The real `local-ai-runtime.erofs` is now CI-proven: the current source lock produced byte-identical A/B builds in one job, the EROFS was mounted read-only, the exact model loaded, eight real completion tokens were generated on loopback-only HTTP, and the same runtime produced a real `OK` chat completion inside the pinned Alpine 3.22.5 userspace used by Stable Base. The current candidate engine SHA-256 is `4a974691b9905b88cb46d97c85c2b035b33592a16cd0239ae4c6687f68799afe` (17,039,584 bytes); the current EROFS candidate SHA-256 is `b244056dad3609357e8a70433f53f41becacd8f3bd93da3d8b23f9e99d86e11a` (568,061,952 bytes). `prototype-ordax.release-manifest/4` already binds this payload to the canonical source lock and content-addressed AI runtime store. The Local AI candidate workflow now also owns a non-promotional integration gate that signs a v4 envelope with an ephemeral CI-only key, serves the three artifacts over loopback HTTPS, materializes them through `materialize-portable-v4`, revalidates them offline, and byte-compares the content-addressed stored AI EROFS with the real built runtime. This proves the real-byte protocol/materialization path without activation or physical media. Canonical v4 signing and exact prerelease materialization are now proven and bound; stable `latest` channel promotion and the real physical Stable USB proof remain pending.

### First run, regional preferences and physical keyboard

The Native/USB first-use flow is now implemented as a persistent device-owned OOBE rather than a presentation-only screen. It follows `welcome -> regional -> network -> security -> account -> privacy -> ready`, stores completion separately from preferences, local-session credentials and online identity, and does not dismiss until durable state has been written. The Security step can configure an optional offline PIN/passphrase through `ordax.local-session/1`; the secret stays transient in Surface memory and never enters `first-run.json`. When configured, the Native host stores only a salted scrypt verifier in private device state and a new Surface session starts locked. The lock keeps the existing Workspace mounted but makes the Surface inert until local authentication succeeds. This is explicitly a session gate, not USB file encryption. The MVP always offers a local-only route: account creation/sign-in is optional and capability-driven, provider unavailability does not block first use, and cloud sync is not an MVP requirement. Network setup is skippable and reuses the existing Native network-management port; Wi-Fi credentials remain transient and do not enter first-run state.

Regional choices are real persisted preferences. The first-use OOBE retains translations for `pt-BR`, `en-US`, `es-ES`, `de-DE` and `fr-FR`, while the public MVP selectors expose only `pt-BR` and `en-US`; both are complete across the shared Surface. Spanish, German and French remain accepted compatibility/future-rollout locales with translated OOBE source but are hidden from the public selectors until their Surface coverage reaches the same launch standard. PT-BR remains the source/default locale. The default time zone is `America/Bahia`, and locale/time zone remain editable later under **Ajustes -> Idioma e região**. Physical keyboard layout is a separate Native device capability, not a Web preference: `br-abnt2` is the Stable/MVP default and `us` is the alternative. The selected layout is stored privately on the USB and mapped to fixed `XKB_DEFAULT_*` values before Cage starts. Arbitrary XKB values and shell input from HTTP are rejected. When the configured layout differs from the layout already applied to the running compositor, Ajustes reports that a new Surface start is required; no fake live-switch behavior is claimed. The OOBE keyboard selector intentionally remains hidden until a safe current-session application or pre-Surface handoff exists.

On the target notebook, the owner/development USB has physically proven the Git-first native host: Cage/Wayland + Barkery/WebKitGTK renders the shared Surface fullscreen; keyboard and mouse/touchpad work; authenticated native restart and shutdown work; and Git changes can be pulled and applied with a Surface reload while the notebook remains running. The temporary live-update marker appeared and then disappeared automatically in the same running session, proving the rebootless update round trip.

The Git-first update path is now split between a stable `system/entrypoint` guardian and a child `system/supervisor`. Ordinary Surface changes reload the browser, native-host changes restart only the Surface, supervisor/guardian changes use a controlled supervisor restart, and boot/bootstrap changes are marked as requiring a later reboot instead of rebooting automatically. The guardian monitors the supervisor's state-file heartbeat and can restart a stalled supervisor child without returning to the Development Base maintenance shell. The controlled `exit 75 -> guardian refresh -> supervisor restart` path has been physically exercised on the target notebook.

Recovery no longer depends on that supervisor alone. A persistent, bounded `ordax-rescue` agent lives under `/state/ordax/rescue/` and consumes only target-bound, monotonic commands from the separate Git rescue ref. The physical notebook has acknowledged multiple rescue generations, including no-op generations while healthy. The rescue protocol does not provide remote shell, arbitrary commands, reboot, poweroff or arbitrary Git reset.

Operational observability is also physically active through the temporary Supabase relay. A host-base telemetry agent starts before the graphical runtime and reports checkout SHA, human `deliveryNumber`, pending `bootRefreshRequired`, updater state, health state, rescue generation/action, power-action proof fields and a supervisor state-file heartbeat. The deployed relay configuration is source-controlled. Supabase is observation-only and has no command semantics. This allowed the recovery from the stale `d071477a` graphical session to be diagnosed and verified without relying on the visible screen.

A native-host update delivered through the live Git path has been physically validated to restart only the Surface and return to the graphical session without rebooting the notebook. Candidate Git objects are now preflighted before switching the live checkout, and the valid-candidate success path has been physically exercised; rejection/rollback of an intentionally broken candidate remains a separate physical exercise. The development Base channel also materializes an exact-commit `rootfs.tar` into a versioned root. Acquisition is delegated by the supervisor to the persistent base-update owner and runs inside the replaceable native runtime, so the minimal development Base does not gain a Python dependency. The Git-refreshable `ordax-dev-init` then selects that root only when its SHA matches the one-shot A/B candidate slot. The mapping is per slot and preserves the seed Base as the legacy fallback. The selector/materializer is source/CI work only: `dev-base-ready-sha` is not yet consumed by an ESP staging/one-shot activation owner, so this change does not arm a boot candidate. Disposable selector proof, authorized A/B staging and broken-candidate physical rollback remain separate gates; none is claimed as physical proof here. The durable offline sync-state store is implemented and CI-proven; survival of a deliberately created pending mutation across a later explicit Surface restart remains a separate physical persistence exercise.

These development-USB results do **not** imply that the canonical signed release-acquisition/native-disk product path is complete. `GRAPHICAL_SURFACE_COMPLETE` and `CANONICAL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPLETE` remain `NO` until their separate product gates close.

The physical evidence is recorded in `docs/evidence/physical-native-surface-2026-09-17.md`. The original BusyBox `command -v` handoff failure was corrected in PR #21 and subsequent owner/development USB boots progressed through the Git checkout into the graphical Surface, so that historical bring-up blocker is closed for this development path.

```

GitHub Actions remains the current build/proof executor; repository recipes are source authority. Kernel/build reproducibility, Action pinning and deterministic real-`system/` bundling remain CI-proven. The current A/B base staging code is also exercised on a disposable FAT32 loop image: the proof preserves current/recovery entries and the active slot, writes and verifies the inactive candidate, unmounts, runs read-only `fsck.vfat`, remounts and re-verifies bytes. That proof is explicitly filesystem-staging-only: it does not exercise canonical release trust, authorize physical writes, activate a candidate or prove notebook boot. CI proof does not authorize destructive physical writes or substitute for hardware validation.

## Physical architecture

The capacity-independent bootstrap seed and the current transitional USB prepared by Creator are different artifacts and must not be collapsed into one partition count:

```text
BOOTSTRAP_SEED_PARTITIONS=2
BOOTSTRAP_SEED_PARTITION_NAMES=ORDAX-ESP,ORDAX
SEED_PARTITION_1_FILESYSTEM=FAT32
SEED_PARTITION_2_FILESYSTEM=EXT4
PREPARED_USB_PARTITIONS=3
PREPARED_USB_PARTITION_NAMES=ORDAX-ESP,ORDAX,ORDAX-DATA
PREPARED_PARTITION_1_FILESYSTEM=FAT32
PREPARED_PARTITION_2_FILESYSTEM=EXT4
PREPARED_PARTITION_3_FILESYSTEM=EXFAT
SEPARATE_HOME_PARTITION=NO
LEGACY_ORDAX_PLATFORM_PARTITION=FORBIDDEN
LEGACY_ORDAX_HOME_PARTITION=FORBIDDEN
```

`docs/contracts/physical-media.json` is authoritative for the two-partition capacity-independent seed (`ORDAX-ESP` + `ORDAX`). `docs/contracts/physical-prepared-media.json` is authoritative for the current **transitional Owner/Development** prepared USB (`ORDAX-ESP` + bounded `ORDAX` + target-capacity-specific `ORDAX-DATA`). These counts describe different validation artifacts and are not the final Stable/MVP layout. The legacy/transitional release tree remains validation-only and must not become the public MVP default.

The durable MVP target is portable USB v2:

```text
ORDAX-ESP   FAT32
ORDAX-DATA  exFAT
  -> .ordax/base/stable-base.erofs
  -> .ordax/releases/<commit>/system.erofs
  -> .ordax/releases/<commit>/surface-runtime.sha256
  -> .ordax/runtimes/sha256/<runtime-sha256>/native-surface-runtime.erofs
  -> .ordax/state/persistent-state.img   # ext4-in-file
```

Mutable activation authority (`current`, `known-good`, `candidate`, `rejected` and `activation-transaction.json`) lives inside the ext4 persistent-state image, never as a mutable exFAT symlink/pointer. Portable v2 remains the storage/bootstrap compatibility shape; the current Stable/MVP candidate uses signed `release-manifest/4`, binding `system.erofs`, the content-addressed Surface runtime and the content-addressed Local AI runtime/source-lock identity. `release-manifest/3` remains a verified compatibility baseline for pre-v4 devices and for the already-proven v3 activation evidence; it is not the current MVP release shape. The Stable Base remains a separate immutable minimal OS EROFS. The fixed initramfs candidate owns exact release selection, capsule/Base verification, system/runtime EROFS mounts and the read-only-to-ephemeral OverlayFS handoff; signature authority remains in the bootstrap-owned release agent. The Stable supervisor is v4-aware: it inspects the signed manifest schema, selects exact v3 or v4 materialization/verification, blocks v3 downgrade after a v4 boot, and preserves the one-shot `candidate -> cold-health -> commit/rollback` lifecycle. The dedicated disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 proof now proves boot handoff with the Local AI runtime plus safe fallback, while the older v3 one-shot proof remains compatibility evidence for candidate rejection/rollback behavior. This still does **not** prove cold-health commit, physical Stable/MVP USB boot, Secure Boot, physical known-good or physical rollback. The graphical cold-health path is intentionally not synthesized in CI: the actual product path requires Cage/Wayland/WebKit/seatd plus the native host and Surface heartbeat/health handshake with the exact release SHA, and no equivalent headless product mode is currently implemented.

The offline Stable/MVP graphical runtime is a separate EROFS artifact with a full 253-package Alpine lock and repeat-digest proof. It deliberately excludes generated machine identity and Fontconfig caches from signed bytes. Release-manifest/3 binds that runtime by SHA-256, Creator preseeds the content-addressed bytes, the candidate PID1 re-verifies v3 offline and mounts the runtime read-only beneath an ephemeral OverlayFS in `/run`, and the Stable launcher refuses boot-time `apk add` provisioning. The exact runtime-v3 handoff was proven at source `b9e1b164d7510f2dfc7572e473642b8fb885fa8c` in both direct-kernel QEMU and non-Secure-Boot OVMF/UEFI with networking disabled and no physical target touched. **This proves the signed offline runtime handoff, not a complete graphical Surface session on real hardware; the final Stable/MVP USB graphical boot remains a physical validation gate.**

Portable v2 itself has now crossed the CI boot-handoff gate with the final two-partition layout: the direct-kernel QEMU proof and the UEFI/OVMF + systemd-boot proof both reached `ORDAX_PORTABLE_V2_HANDOFF=VERIFIED` and `ORDAX_STABLE_INIT_HANDOFF=VERIFIED`, selected the exact `current` slot/source identity, ran with QEMU networking disabled, destroyed disposable guest state afterward and did not touch a physical target device. The UEFI proof uses non-Secure-Boot OVMF; **Secure Boot and physical USB boot remain unproven**.

CI proof remains distinct from physical boot evidence and does not authorize the public writer.

## Minimal bootstrap and canonical release path

The product bootstrap/release architecture remains distinct from the owner/development USB Git path.

The canonical release channel resolves `release-envelope.json`; the URL selects bytes and Ed25519 verification decides authenticity. The release acquisition code remains fail-closed with SHA-256 verification, exact source-commit binding, safe materialization, atomic activation and known-good preservation.

The eligible Windows trust toolkit from canonical `main` source `2172eb6a18430910afd036199ec492ad63dc185d` (workflow run `35617567458`) completed operator steps 1, 2 and 3 on 2026-09-21. The uploaded `OrdaX-Public-Trust-Handoff.zip` was then independently revalidated: archive shape, exact public hashes and the recovered Ed25519 signing proof all passed. The exact public anchor is pinned at `bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json`, and the minimal bootstrap trust group is resolved. The private key remains outside Git/USB/Actions artifacts and is not recorded here. A same-host encrypted backup copy was verified byte-for-byte; this is accepted for the first controlled prototype but is not independent off-device custody, which remains required before broad public distribution. Public trust promotion itself did not authorize destructive media writes. On 2026-09-22 the owner provided the exact Stable/MVP authorization phrase for scope `first-real-stable-mvp-usb-proof`, release sequence 1, bound to the then-current 15-artifact writer context; later writer changes invalidated that consent. On 2026-09-26 the exact v4 candidate was signed, published as a prerelease, materialized and verified by the source-owned agent, aggregated with the signed-handoff proof, and bound to the physical authorization contract. The proof binds source commit `b924ff8d74d1761232381ae3f9604bba17497cfd`, manifest SHA-256 `ddab1681ffecacca000ff1014d3b354978c1f4a785985998b673816e18e65b85`, envelope SHA-256 `cc89cf7436357c5d479624d74e32325d4eb249a6fc1334385fb55827c313f5c9` and proof SHA-256 `2dd17580ddbf5a0fd0433a912e97e6bded04fd0a44ea0849e9da15e13df01e4b`. The prerelease did not move GitHub's stable `latest` channel. The current writer change invalidates the previously recorded owner consent, so the authorization contract is fail-closed with `physical_write_allowed=false`; fresh explicit owner authorization is required before any target-specific preparation or application. No USB is selected or currently authorized for a new destructive write; live USB revalidation, Windows UAC and target-specific destructive confirmation remain later independent gates.

The Windows destructive backend remains compile-time isolated behind `ordax_raw_backend` and unreachable from the public Creator command. The final Portable writer is now implemented inside that tagged boundary: it executes the Core-owned 39-operation `ORDAX-ESP + ORDAX-DATA` plan, with 17 exact artifacts including the Local AI runtime and its signed-release digest reference, and performs per-artifact sync/readback SHA-256+size verification without a target-sized whole-disk RAW image. **Implementation alone does not authorize use.** Canonical v4 trust, proof and source bindings resolve, but the current writer change invalidates the previously recorded owner authorization. Fresh explicit owner consent must be recorded against the current authorization context before a destructive candidate can be prepared or applied. The candidate release is a prerelease and has not moved the stable `latest` channel. Public reachability remains closed, and choosing/revalidating a concrete USB plus Windows UAC and the target-specific destructive confirmation remain separate execution gates.

The byte-complete media workflow remains proven with ephemeral CI trust and disposable media only. That proof establishes composition and growth behavior; it does not establish canonical public trust or authorize a product-media write. The notebook development-USB boot is a separate physical proof and must not be used to collapse those boundaries.

Do not reinterpret `PASS_DEVELOPMENT_USB` as canonical release/install proof. The proven target today is the owner/development Git-first USB on the tested notebook.

The source-controlled Stable/MVP physical smoke harness is now ready for the verified Stable runtime and remains non-promotional until executed on the real Stable/MVP USB. The running Surface publishes a private ephemeral proof context, and the harness fails closed unless that context identifies the exact Owner/Development dynamic runtime or `stable-mvp + verified-erofs-overlay + canonical-stable-mvp` with its verified runtime SHA-256. The Stable graphical runtime no longer depends on or mounts a Git repository. The smoke also checks configured/applied physical keyboard state, preserves baseline/after comparison, rejects mixed runtime evidence, and requires all 12 manual tour items — including Account/Memory without requiring an online login — plus a fresh fail-closed finalization. This is source/CI readiness only: `MVP_SURFACE_SMOKE_PHYSICAL=PENDING` and `CANONICAL_STABLE_GRAPHICAL_MODE=PENDING` remain authoritative until real hardware evidence exists.

```

## Current priorities

The disposable QEMU activation inspectors replay only the committed ext4 journal
on a copied persistent-state image before mounting that copy read-only. QEMU is
stopped after a durable serial marker without a clean guest unmount, so inspecting
with `noload` before journal replay can expose uncheckpointed metadata. General
filesystem repair is forbidden; the original guest disk remains untouched by
inspection and is reused for the independent second boot. This correction does
not itself establish a passing cold-health or physical proof.

1. prioritize the Stable/MVP **USB system path**: preserve the green source/QEMU/UEFI path, complete canonical signed Stable v4 materialization with the proven local-AI runtime, then close the later real-hardware gates for first canonical USB boot, cold health, known-good promotion and rollback without coupling ordinary app changes to a full system reboot;
2. keep the **local inference payload** pinned and reproducible: the exact llama.cpp/model artifacts, real-byte v4 materialization and disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 path are already CI-proven; the remaining non-physical release gate is canonical Stable signing/materialization, without making AI boot-critical;
3. keep PT-BR/en-US launch coverage regression-closed and continue Spanish, German and French migration without exposing those hidden compatibility locales as complete before their Surface coverage reaches the same standard;
4. keep the current first-party apps useful and coherent as Beta components, focusing app work on correctness, regression coverage and genuine MVP gaps; move an app toward production-independent packaging only when the signed `component-slot` path is actually ready to prove it;
5. continue hardening staged/transactional Owner/Development Git-first activation while keeping it explicitly separate from the Stable/MVP public update channel;
6. execute the integrated Surface smoke only on the eventual Stable/MVP physical USB for canonical promotion; Owner/Development evidence remains development-only and CI or an unexecuted runbook must never become physical PASS;
7. continue account/cloud preference and workspace continuity through neutral contracts without making an authenticated provider or cloud sync an MVP boot dependency;
8. keep the already-pinned canonical Ed25519 public trust stable, keep private signing material outside Git/CI/chat, and treat independent off-device custody plus managed non-exportable signing as broad-distribution hardening rather than an unfinished first-prototype trust ceremony;
9. keep all physical writers fail-closed after scope authorization until non-published candidate review, exact target confirmation/UAC and post-write verification are deliberately completed; source/CI readiness alone never selects or authorizes erasing a particular USB;
10. continue product experience work that does not weaken boot safety, including the early graphical OrdaX splash with mandatory text fallback; leave suspend/resume, audio, acceleration-quality, long-run and broader-hardware exercises for final physical validation unless an MVP gate depends on them sooner.

The temporary Supabase project is an operational relay, not product authority. It may be migrated later without changing the device identity or telemetry contract. Git `main` remains product source authority; `ordax-rescue` remains a separate, deliberately narrow recovery path.

## Canonical documentation freshness

The Foundation regression suite compares this snapshot against structured owners for product version, first-party app versions/release modes and seed/transitional-media geometry. A source change that makes those values stale must fail CI until the canonical snapshot and nomenclature contract are updated in the same change. Portable v2 remains governed separately by `docs/contracts/portable-usb-v2.json`; transitional geometry must never be mistaken for the final public MVP target.

## Handoff rule

Any new AI/conversation must read `AGENTS.md`, this file and the canonical contracts before changing source. It must also reconcile current structured source with the snapshot before planning work from a historical statement. CI alone never proves physical boot, native graphics or destructive safety. For the tested owner/development USB notebook, physical native graphics/input/power/live-update claims are supported by `docs/evidence/physical-native-surface-2026-09-17.md`; those claims still do not promote CI trust, authorize physical mutation, prove canonical signed release acquisition or declare the product complete.


## Runtime component trust identity

The signed `component-slot` protocol intentionally uses a trust domain separate
from whole-OS release signing. Source now defines the operator ceremony and
fail-closed policy for the first component identity, but no canonical component
key is pinned yet.

```text
COMPONENT_TRUST_DOMAIN=runtime-components
COMPONENT_TRUST_KEY_ID=ordax-runtime-components-v1
COMPONENT_TRUST_CEREMONY=PENDING_OPERATOR_EXECUTION
CANONICAL_COMPONENT_TRUST_ANCHOR_PINNED=NO
COMPONENT_PUBLISH_ALLOWED=NO
PRODUCTION_COMPONENT_SLOT_ACTIVATION_ALLOWED=NO
```

Only a reviewed public anchor may later enter
`system/trust/runtime-components-ed25519.json`. The matching private key remains
external to Git/device and must pass independent derivation plus encrypted-recovery
signing proof before public pinning.

The Native Surface now has a fail-closed, read-only component-slot broker backed
by the signed `ordax-runtime-component-channel` helper. It is available only for
Stable/MVP USB when both the helper and a real component trust file exist, and it
revalidates component bytes through the verifier rather than trusting writable
slot paths directly. Source also implements the next non-activation layers: a
pending probation loader, an internal Native health recorder bound to the exact
component identity and probation revision, a system-owned nonce-bound health
bridge, and a fail-closed promotion policy that can only return hold/reject/promote
decisions. The bridge does not expose generic HTTP mutation authority and neither
the recorder nor the policy executes promotion, rejection or rollback. Because the
canonical component trust file is not pinned, the broker remains unavailable in
the current product and production component-slot activation is still blocked.
The next authority boundary is a separate Native executor consuming exact
revision+identity policy decisions only after canonical component trust and the
promotion/rollback proof gates are satisfied.

Account-owned and Space-owned Memory are currently local OrdaX Memory ownership domains, not a released cloud-sync claim. The dedicated control-plane database contains RLS-protected `ordax_memory_items` plus a separate sync-object stream, and the server-authoritative `ordax_apply_memory_mutation_v1` boundary is deployed so canonical Memory and its sync/tombstone mirror advance atomically. The manual proof harness is now source-ready for two independent authenticated sessions of the same dedicated non-admin account: Client A creates/edits/deletes while Client B independently consumes the incremental sync stream, attempts a stale mutation that must be rejected, and verifies the canonical deleted state. Public cloud Memory remains disabled because execution still requires a deliberately preprovisioned `memory.cloud.enabled` entitlement and a real authenticated run; the proof itself never creates that grant or uses service-role authority. The operator-only issue/revoke boundary is now deployed in `ordax-control-plane`, owned by `postgres` and inaccessible to `anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role`; no proof entitlement has been issued and the live active-grant count remains zero. Independent client dual-write remains forbidden; device/session/project/restricted Memory remain outside the initial cloud-sync eligibility boundary.

### Operational realtime / Web / Mobile foundation

The product now has a provider-neutral source contract separating account synchronization
from live operational events and remote device actions. `ordax.operational-event/1` uses
Space-scoped aggregate identity, server sequence and revision; device mutations use
`ordax.device-action-request/1` + `ordax.device-action-receipt/1` and must be matched
to an explicit approved Device Agent write grant.

This foundation is intentionally non-activating. There is no released Android APK, no public
operational realtime transport and no public remote-device Action Gateway yet. Web/Mobile/
Desktop/Native/MCP share the same future action boundary; account sync is not a command queue,
notifications are not source of truth, and push payloads are not command authority.

Machine-readable owner: `docs/contracts/operational-realtime.json`.

## Personal OrdaX orchestration foundation

Personal OrdaX is now a mounted **Native foreground orchestration** capability, not merely a
source-only architecture stub. It reuses the canonical identity session, Space selection, Projects,
Memory/Intelligence and tool-grant authorities; it does not own a parallel identity, Memory, sync,
permission or project system.

`ordax.personal-work-item/1` binds every Work item to the exact device/account owner and optional
explicit Space/project. `ordax.personal-activity/1` is the ordered user-visible activity stream,
`ordax.personal-work-result/1` stores bounded reasoning results with fixed `authority=none`, and
approvals/decisions/attempts are persisted in the same owner partition. Account/Space/project
changes pause affected active Work and cannot silently retarget it. Stale inference responses are
discarded.

### Personal OrdaX foreground runtime

The Native composition mounts the canonical Personal OrdaX runtime plus its owner-partitioned
device store and Activity app. The Surface supports deliberate Work creation, visible
`waiting-approval`, explicit pause/resume/cancel/remove, approval/deny controls and bounded result
review. Durable owner records are capped and validated; corrupt durable bytes are preserved rather
than silently reset. Account sync remains separate from operational Work state.

One real foreground side effect is enabled:
`ordax-native-file-space/files.directory.ensure`. It is intentionally narrow and idempotent.
Execution requires an explicit human approval, a short-lived exact grant, matching
owner/Space/project/Work/approval/resource/tool/action/effect, matching SHA-256 identity for the
tool/adapter artifact, and final revalidation immediately before the adapter is resolved. The
runtime persists an `ordax.personal-action-attempt/1` before adapter entry. A crash or ambiguous
post-adapter failure becomes `uncertain`, revokes live authority and pauses Work; there is no
automatic replay.

The authority-free Action Proposal boundary is source-ready and connected to an explicit
foreground planner action. The catalog can produce an ephemeral
`ordax.personal-action-proposal/1` only for an existing nonterminal Work in the current owner
partition and a registered Action Catalog entry. The planner sees only
`entryId + inputKind + resourceScheme`, requires exact JSON and revalidates the candidate through
the catalog. A proposal carries only `workItemId + entryId + resourceValue + rationale`, fixes
`authority=none`, `executionAuthorized=false` and `approvalRequested=false`, and rejects
tool/action IDs, canonical resource references, grants, approvals, decisions, effects and artifact
identities. Proposal -> approval remains a separate explicit user action and there is no automatic
proposal -> execution path.

Semantic Work recovery is also source-ready as an explicit foreground lookup. Only current-owner
`queued|paused` Work without unresolved authority is eligible. Intelligence sees
`workItemId + goal + state + spaceBound + projectBound` and never receives owner/Space/Project
IDs. The returned `ordax.personal-work-recovery-suggestion/1` carries no authority, cannot switch
context and cannot resume automatically. A runtime-local binding pins owner and exact Work revision;
accepting a paused match delegates to the canonical `resume()`, which still fails closed unless
the original Space/Project context is valid.

Background/autonomous execution remains disabled. Generic external egress, device-control, shell,
raw disk, release-key access, physical writes, non-idempotent file mutations, model-generated action
proposal generation, specialist workers and hybrid cloud execution are not enabled by this runtime.

# Current State

Status date: 2026-09-25

This is the canonical handoff snapshot. Architecture/contracts win if another document conflicts with it. Detailed historical evidence remains under `docs/evidence/`; this file records the current boundary without treating CI proof, development-hardware proof and product-release authorization as interchangeable. Values that mirror structured source — including product/app versions, component release modes and physical-media geometry — are regression-checked against their owners so this snapshot cannot silently drift from the implementation.

The canonical prototype trust ceremony and public handoff are complete. The eligible toolkit bound to `2172eb6a18430910afd036199ec492ad63dc185d` passed read-only preflight; canonical Ed25519 key material was generated locally, independent public derivation matched, the proof signature passed, recovery was verified from a distinct restored copy, and the recovered signing envelope passed public verification. The exact public anchor is pinned in Git and the minimal-bootstrap trust binding remains resolved. An earlier owner authorization existed for the first Stable/MVP USB proof, release sequence 1, but it was bound to the previous 15-artifact physical-writer context. The Stable/MVP v4 payload now contains 17 exact artifacts, adding the content-addressed Local AI runtime plus its release reference, so that prior consent is deliberately invalidated and the source-controlled authorization contract now fails closed at `blocked-canonical-v4-release-proof-pending` with `physical_write_allowed=false`; only after the canonical v4 proof is executed and bound may it advance to `blocked-explicit-physical-authorization-pending`. No USB is selected or erasable; fresh owner consent, live target revalidation, Windows UAC and target-specific destructive confirmation remain separate later gates. The local PEM remains a controlled prototype signing backend rather than the intended long-term production custody model; independent off-device custody and managed non-exportable KMS/HSM remain broad-distribution hardening requirements, with signed trust rotation required before broad public distribution.

The first formal human product version is **OrdaX Prototype v0.1.0**. Product version, Entrega, Git SHA and component/app versions are separate identities: v0.1.0 identifies the prototype product milestone, Entrega identifies the notebook-facing delivery sequence, the SHA remains the exact technical build identity, and each component may evolve its own SemVer. First-party apps on the `0.x` line are **Beta**; `1.0.0` remains reserved for the first stable release of each app. Internet is currently `0.3.0 Beta`, Notes is `0.4.0 Beta` and Projetos is `0.1.0 Beta`; all three use `git-app` in Owner/Development. Arquivos, Ajustes, Conta and Sistema are `0.1.0 Beta` and remain `bundled`. A component having its own version does not mean it already has a production-independent update channel: `git-app` is a development delivery mode, while production-independent activation remains gated behind the signed `component-slot` path with pending health, promotion and rollback. Product v1.0 remains reserved for the stable product rather than being inferred from prototype maturity, component versions or delivery count.

`system/` is the shared product source. The native development path is physically proven through `system/entrypoint (guardian) -> system/supervisor -> system/surface/entrypoint -> system/surface/bin/ordax-surface`; repository CI also proves that the actual `system/` tree can be bundled deterministically as `system.tar`.

The shared graphical source remains under `system/surface/ui/` with platform-neutral contracts, workspace/window lifecycle and capability-driven app availability. Projects is a first-party application with stable app id `projects`, version `0.1.0 Beta` and `git-app` delivery in Owner/Development. It consumes the existing neutral local project catalog and optional `ordax.project-cloud-links/1` overlay; it does not create a second project store, require an account, upload local files by default or change local project identity. Web currently degrades honestly when no local/cloud project catalog is supplied. Notes is a first-party **application** with stable app id `notes`, version `0.4.0 Beta` and `git-app` delivery in Owner/Development. Native/USB may enrich it through the optional `filesystem.user-space` capability, and a future signed `component-slot`/app-package flow can target that same app identity instead of creating a Native-only fork. A general Store/package manager and production-independent app updater are not implemented yet. Notes provides local projects, a visual structured-text editor, editable checklists, real local-file/web references, autosave and device-local Native persistence through a bounded loopback state endpoint; Web uses local browser persistence with an explicit session fallback. Notes stores rich formatting as bounded blocks/marks rather than raw HTML or visible Markdown, keeps a plain-text body for search/import continuity, and migrates existing local snapshot schema v1 state to schema v2 on validation/save. Project organization now has a complete local lifecycle: projects can be renamed, non-base projects can be removed without deleting their notes, selected notes can move between projects, and checklist items can be removed. The stable `Meu espaço` project remains the non-destructive fallback for notes from removed projects. Internet is the first-party browser app with stable id `internet`, version `0.3.0 Beta` and `git-app` delivery in Owner/Development; this version identity does not claim a production Store/updater. Its shared Surface owns the approved concept structure (navigation toolbar, workspace/tab rail, central web viewport and project-context panel), while Native/USB provide `browser.web-content` through a separate unprivileged WebKit context and one external WebView per tab. The native slice supports up to 16 tabs, back/forward/reload, tab search, keyboard accelerators, persisted public tab URLs/order/active tab, project-context selection, explicit saved web references with bounded per-reference notes, automatic reference cleanup after project removal, public-network filtering and an exact loopback Host/browser-provenance boundary. Saved project references are owned by a neutral project-domain runtime and persist in the Native privileged profile with honest session fallback; the external page never receives project storage capability. Web intentionally exposes an unavailable browser-session port rather than pretending arbitrary sites can be safely embedded. Notes web references activate this same `internet` app. Internet also owns bounded device-local favorites through a neutral `ordax.browser-favorites/1` port; the Native privileged profile persists them while external website WebViews receive no access to that store. Native hardware proof for the new WebKit host remains pending, so the browser slice is implemented in source but not yet marked physically proven. Ajustes now owns persisted Surface-level contrast, motion and text-scale preferences; text scale changes the shared typographic base without claiming host-level accessibility control. Platform-specific behavior belongs in adapters/compositions, not in forks of the shared Surface. The normal Home now keeps technical delivery/recovery markers out of the area label; real delivery identity and update details live in Sistema. The visible settings identity is standardized as **Ajustes** while preserving the stable internal app id `settings`.

### Nova OrdaX pre-USB functional closure

The legacy/product-vision audit has been revalidated before the first Stable/MVP
physical USB. `PLANO-03-FECHAMENTO-PRE-USB-NOVA-ORDAX.md` is now the active
pre-USB closure plan. Physical media work is intentionally held while the remaining
class-A product gaps are closed. Ordax Intelligence consumers, Native local
session/lock, safe Files removal and PT-BR/en-US launch-language coverage are now
source-complete. The remaining pre-USB class-A release gap is the canonical
signed/materializable v4 release that carries the proven local-AI runtime.
Diagnostics/recovery presentation and the conservative MVP hardware-support matrix
are source-complete; their target-hardware/physical proofs remain later gates.

The v4 Creator payload change deliberately revokes the stale 15-artifact authorization
context instead of widening it. Source/CI work may continue, but destructive authority
cannot even reach owner-consent preflight until the operator-controlled canonical v4
signing/materialization sequence has produced `canonical-v4-release-proof.json` and that
public receipt has been validated and bound to the authorization contract. Only then may
fresh owner consent be evaluated for the exact 17-artifact v4 release. The physical Creator
now keeps writer/tooling provenance separate from release identity: the writer embeds its own
Git SHA as provenance plus the canonical v4 release source commit from
`physical-write-authorization.json -> release_binding.source_commit`. Target-specific
Portable media/application plans must use that canonical release commit, and
`prepare-portable`/`apply-portable` fail closed unless it matches; the v4 writer accepts
exactly 17 canonical artifact sources, never the previous 15-source shape.

### Pre-MVP ecosystem foundation

A separate product-domain foundation is now defined before public accounts carry real data. The account model distinguishes one OrdaX identity from **Spaces** and versioned **Profile Packs**; the initial Developer and Legal-BR packs are draft descriptors only and do not activate professional-domain behavior. Billing, prices and commercial tier names remain undefined. A provisional two-private-Space default exists only as an internal capacity foundation and is not a public commercial claim.

Persistent Intelligence memory is now implemented as OrdaX-owned through `ordax.memory/1`, with explicit `device|account` ownership, device/account/space/project/session scopes, provenance, bounded search/review/edit/delete semantics and durable `flush()` confirmation. Native/USB owns a bounded private atomic memory state through a loopback-only endpoint and mounts the memory runtime fail-soft; Web fallback is explicitly ephemeral and cannot pretend durable device/account/Space/project state. `ordax.memory-context-auth/1` and the authorized-memory bridge require composition-layer authorization before any memory reaches Intelligence, and ordinary Intelligence requests still inject no memory automatically. `ordax.model-router/1` is now active in the Intelligence runtime, binds local routes to `engineId + modelId` and keeps future OpenAI/xAI routes fail-closed without explicit egress plus an enabled adapter. Local AI remains the offline baseline and no inference provider owns persistent memory.

The dedicated Supabase project `ordax-control-plane` is the selected pre-MVP backend target for the product schema. The source-controlled migrations under `infra/supabase/product/` have been applied: `ordax_accounts`, Spaces/membership, server-authoritative entitlement grants, versioned Profile Packs, memory metadata + pgvector embeddings and project-connection metadata all use RLS. The older duplicate `ordax_profiles` migration was removed so Auth has one OrdaX product bootstrap owner. The Supabase password provider is implemented and the OrdaX account gateway is deployed to the dedicated control-plane backend. Sign-in, sign-up, refresh, validated session state and logout use HttpOnly cookies and never expose provider tokens to Surface JavaScript. Account sync now uses an atomic initial snapshot plus a subject-bound persisted incremental cursor for appearance, portable preferences and workspace metadata on Web and Native/USB. **Public browser login remains fail-closed** pending the same-origin production hosting boundary, leaked-password protection, remaining Auth hardening and legal readiness. The Account Surface now also has a minimal read-only Spaces view on Web and Native/USB: it consumes only `/account/spaces`, validates a bounded provider-neutral projection, clears cached Space data on sign-out and never invents a local Space. The v13 gateway is now deployed as Edge Function revision 16 and performs user-bearer RLS reads only. Public browser account access and account-close execution remain disabled.

A Product MCP boundary is also specified separately from the owner/development Control Plane. Future ChatGPT/Grok clients authenticate to OrdaX OAuth, then receive only account/Space/project-scoped tools. GitHub is a separate connection, preferably through a GitHub App restricted to selected repositories; upstream GitHub credentials are never returned to the external model. Public Product MCP deployment, mutating tools, connectors and automations remain post-MVP functionality.

This foundation does not change the current physical release gate:

### System diagnostics and recovery presentation

Sistema now composes the existing Native diagnostic-review owner instead of passing a
null controller. The review remains explicit, local and sanitized, and can copy/export
only through the existing bounded adapters.

A separate `ordax.recovery-status/1` observer exposes factual Portable v2 state:
running slot/source, current, known-good, candidate/activation transaction and the
actual recovery loader entry on ORDAX-ESP. The recovery entry is not accepted by
presence alone; the observer checks the expected kernel/initramfs/portable-init and
`ordax.mode=recovery` markers. This port is intentionally read-only and exposes no
rollback, reboot, repair, network or mutation authority.

The MVP hardware support matrix is also now canonical in source. It explicitly says
that driver presence is not a support claim and that canonical Stable target hardware
still requires physical proof.

```text

RECOVERY_STATUS_AUTHORITY=READ_ONLY
RECOVERY_STATUS_PHYSICAL_PROOF=PENDING_PHYSICAL
SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_MATRIX=PASS_SOURCE
CANONICAL_STABLE_TARGET_HARDWARE_PROOF=PENDING_PHYSICAL
```

### Shared Surface localization

The Surface now owns `ordax.localization/1`, derived from the existing persisted
`regional.locale` preference rather than a second locale state. The shell is
created in the selected locale on its first frame and re-renders localized shell
copy without rebuilding windows or losing interaction state. English entries now
cover the shared shell, launcher, workspace/window chrome, connectivity labels and
first-party app metadata. Unsupported message IDs fail closed; locales without a
shared translation fall back to PT-BR source copy explicitly.

English is now marked as a complete Surface locale for the public MVP. Files covers its
primary navigation/search/list/selection/Recents/Trash journey, common forms, deep operational
feedback, locale-aware sorting, import/export, copy/move/rename/create-folder flows, preview and
Files → Notes presentation through the shared catalog.
Settings/System cover their section navigation/header copy, and System now also derives
its overview health/summary, memory and user-storage resource views, update transaction details/history, component/update scopes, About/versioning, capability inventory, Intelligence presentation, and the explicit sanitized diagnostic review from structured runtime state through the shared
localization owner. Runtime failure banners in these System flows now retain semantic message IDs and translate at render time, so changing locale does not preserve stale rendered PT-BR copy. Settings now also covers Appearance, Accessibility, Regional preferences,
physical keyboard layout and deep Network/Wi-Fi presentation in PT-BR/en-US through that same owner;
async keyboard/Wi-Fi feedback stores semantic message IDs rather than rendered copy, and Wi-Fi
credentials remain transient interaction state. Settings covers its Notifications policy/source and local-session
Security sections end to end, and the Native live session lock rerenders through the same
localization owner while keeping
the entered secret only in transient repaint memory. Account covers its complete
first-party overview/sync experience in English. Notes now covers its
primary navigation/editor shell, project/list states, core persistence copy,
locale-aware relative time, image/file-picker/checklist/reference flows, capacity/statistics,
prompts/confirmations and consultative Intelligence controls. Its picker/runtime failures retain
semantic message IDs and newly attached local-file metadata no longer persists translated system
labels. Internet now covers its primary browser shell,
locale-aware tab/address search, project context, home status, project references,
favorites/history and first-party operational feedback deeply in PT-BR/en-US. Its own
feedback is stored as semantic message identity so a live locale change does not preserve
stale rendered copy. The shared Home continuation/pending cards, power controls,
global update accelerator, desktop-clock fallback and Surface boot screen also use the shared
localization owner; first-party async feedback retains semantic message identity across live locale
changes. Network and battery tray/quick-panel presentation plus the Notification Center use
`ordax.localization/1` and rerender on locale changes. `ordax.notifications/3` keeps
backward-compatible text fallbacks while first-party update events persist bounded semantic
presentation identity, allowing stored update history to rerender in the active locale without
heuristic text translation. The public MVP selectors expose only PT-BR and en-US. Spanish, German
and French remain OOBE-complete compatibility/future-rollout locales and are not advertised as
complete Surface languages.

### Files safe removal

The Native Files owner now exposes `ordax.file-space/11` with recoverable
`trashEntry()`, `listTrash()` and `restoreTrashEntry()`. The trash payload and
metadata live in a private reserved namespace under the user root that is not valid
as a public logical file-space path. Same-filesystem removal uses no-clobber rename;
restore also uses no-clobber and refuses to overwrite a new item at the original
path. Cross-device trash is rejected rather than converted into an unsafe delete,
and symlinks remain outside the supported boundary. Recent-file references are
cleared when their item is trashed, while Project continuity is invalidated only
after the file operation succeeds. Permanent delete and empty-trash actions are not
part of this MVP flow.

```

### Ordax Intelligence and local inference

Ordax Intelligence is now a first-class system service with stable contract `ordax.intelligence/1`; an Assistant UI is only a possible client. The Native composition now creates the provider-neutral `ordax.local-ai/1 -> ordax.intelligence/1` chain and exposes real consultative first-party consumers: Notes can request a bounded provenance-bearing summary without rewriting the note, and System can request an explanation using only local Surface capabilities/connectivity plus sanitized metrics. Neither consumer imports llama.cpp/Qwen directly, and both retain `authority=none` with tool execution disabled. The service therefore exists as a real system function in source rather than only a model/runtime test. The Stable v4 source handoff is now implemented: Portable v2 verifies `release-manifest/4`, resolves and mounts the content-addressed `local-ai-runtime.erofs` read-only, and Stable Base starts the loopback backend when the verified runtime is available. Intelligence/model failure remains non-boot-critical and degrades the capability instead of blocking boot, Surface, recovery, files or updates. Disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 boot and fallback are now PASS_CI; canonical Stable v4 signing/materialization and the later physical Stable/MVP proof remain separate release gates.

The initial source lock pins Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q4_0 by exact GGUF SHA-256/size and llama.cpp by exact source commit plus the reproducibly observed `llama-server` ELF SHA-256/size. The real `local-ai-runtime.erofs` is now CI-proven: the current source lock produced byte-identical A/B builds in one job, the EROFS was mounted read-only, the exact model loaded, eight real completion tokens were generated on loopback-only HTTP, and the same runtime produced a real `OK` chat completion inside the pinned Alpine 3.22.5 userspace used by Stable Base. The current candidate engine SHA-256 is `4a974691b9905b88cb46d97c85c2b035b33592a16cd0239ae4c6687f68799afe` (17,039,584 bytes); the current EROFS candidate SHA-256 is `b244056dad3609357e8a70433f53f41becacd8f3bd93da3d8b23f9e99d86e11a` (568,061,952 bytes). `prototype-ordax.release-manifest/4` already binds this payload to the canonical source lock and content-addressed AI runtime store. The Local AI candidate workflow now also owns a non-promotional integration gate that signs a v4 envelope with an ephemeral CI-only key, serves the three artifacts over loopback HTTPS, materializes them through `materialize-portable-v4`, revalidates them offline, and byte-compares the content-addressed stored AI EROFS with the real built runtime. This proves the real-byte protocol/materialization path without activation or physical media. What remains pending is canonical Stable/MVP v4 signing/materialization with the controlled release key and the real physical Stable USB proof.

### First run, regional preferences and physical keyboard

The Native/USB first-use flow is now implemented as a persistent device-owned OOBE rather than a presentation-only screen. It follows `welcome -> regional -> network -> security -> account -> privacy -> ready`, stores completion separately from preferences, local-session credentials and online identity, and does not dismiss until durable state has been written. The Security step can configure an optional offline PIN/passphrase through `ordax.local-session/1`; the secret stays transient in Surface memory and never enters `first-run.json`. When configured, the Native host stores only a salted scrypt verifier in private device state and a new Surface session starts locked. The lock keeps the existing Workspace mounted but makes the Surface inert until local authentication succeeds. This is explicitly a session gate, not USB file encryption. The MVP always offers a local-only route: account creation/sign-in is optional and capability-driven, provider unavailability does not block first use, and cloud sync is not an MVP requirement. Network setup is skippable and reuses the existing Native network-management port; Wi-Fi credentials remain transient and do not enter first-run state.

Regional choices are real persisted preferences. The first-use OOBE retains translations for `pt-BR`, `en-US`, `es-ES`, `de-DE` and `fr-FR`, while the public MVP selectors expose only `pt-BR` and `en-US`; both are complete across the shared Surface. Spanish, German and French remain accepted compatibility/future-rollout locales with translated OOBE source but are hidden from the public selectors until their Surface coverage reaches the same launch standard. PT-BR remains the source/default locale. The default time zone is `America/Bahia`, and locale/time zone remain editable later under **Ajustes -> Idioma e região**. Physical keyboard layout is a separate Native device capability, not a Web preference: `br-abnt2` is the Stable/MVP default and `us` is the alternative. The selected layout is stored privately on the USB and mapped to fixed `XKB_DEFAULT_*` values before Cage starts. Arbitrary XKB values and shell input from HTTP are rejected. When the configured layout differs from the layout already applied to the running compositor, Ajustes reports that a new Surface start is required; no fake live-switch behavior is claimed. The OOBE keyboard selector intentionally remains hidden until a safe current-session application or pre-Surface handoff exists.

On the target notebook, the owner/development USB has physically proven the Git-first native host: Cage/Wayland + Barkery/WebKitGTK renders the shared Surface fullscreen; keyboard and mouse/touchpad work; authenticated native restart and shutdown work; and Git changes can be pulled and applied with a Surface reload while the notebook remains running. The temporary live-update marker appeared and then disappeared automatically in the same running session, proving the rebootless update round trip.

The Git-first update path is now split between a stable `system/entrypoint` guardian and a child `system/supervisor`. Ordinary Surface changes reload the browser, native-host changes restart only the Surface, supervisor/guardian changes use a controlled supervisor restart, and boot/bootstrap changes are marked as requiring a later reboot instead of rebooting automatically. The guardian monitors the supervisor's state-file heartbeat and can restart a stalled supervisor child without returning to the Development Base maintenance shell. The controlled `exit 75 -> guardian refresh -> supervisor restart` path has been physically exercised on the target notebook.

Recovery no longer depends on that supervisor alone. A persistent, bounded `ordax-rescue` agent lives under `/state/ordax/rescue/` and consumes only target-bound, monotonic commands from the separate Git rescue ref. The physical notebook has acknowledged multiple rescue generations, including no-op generations while healthy. The rescue protocol does not provide remote shell, arbitrary commands, reboot, poweroff or arbitrary Git reset.

Operational observability is also physically active through the temporary Supabase relay. A host-base telemetry agent starts before the graphical runtime and reports checkout SHA, human `deliveryNumber`, pending `bootRefreshRequired`, updater state, health state, rescue generation/action, power-action proof fields and a supervisor state-file heartbeat. The deployed relay configuration is source-controlled. Supabase is observation-only and has no command semantics. This allowed the recovery from the stale `d071477a` graphical session to be diagnosed and verified without relying on the visible screen.

A native-host update delivered through the live Git path has been physically validated to restart only the Surface and return to the graphical session without rebooting the notebook. Candidate Git objects are now preflighted before switching the live checkout, and the valid-candidate success path has been physically exercised; rejection/rollback of an intentionally broken candidate remains a separate physical exercise. The development Base channel also materializes an exact-commit `rootfs.tar` into a versioned root. Acquisition is delegated by the supervisor to the persistent base-update owner and runs inside the replaceable native runtime, so the minimal development Base does not gain a Python dependency. The Git-refreshable `ordax-dev-init` then selects that root only when its SHA matches the one-shot A/B candidate slot. The mapping is per slot and preserves the seed Base as the legacy fallback. The selector/materializer is source/CI work only: `dev-base-ready-sha` is not yet consumed by an ESP staging/one-shot activation owner, so this change does not arm a boot candidate. Disposable selector proof, authorized A/B staging and broken-candidate physical rollback remain separate gates; none is claimed as physical proof here. The durable offline sync-state store is implemented and CI-proven; survival of a deliberately created pending mutation across a later explicit Surface restart remains a separate physical persistence exercise.

These development-USB results do **not** imply that the canonical signed release-acquisition/native-disk product path is complete. `GRAPHICAL_SURFACE_COMPLETE` and `CANONICAL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPLETE` remain `NO` until their separate product gates close.

The physical evidence is recorded in `docs/evidence/physical-native-surface-2026-09-17.md`. The original BusyBox `command -v` handoff failure was corrected in PR #21 and subsequent owner/development USB boots progressed through the Git checkout into the graphical Surface, so that historical bring-up blocker is closed for this development path.

GitHub Actions remains the current build/proof executor; repository recipes are source authority. Kernel/build reproducibility, Action pinning and deterministic real-`system/` bundling remain CI-proven. The current A/B base staging code is also exercised on a disposable FAT32 loop image: the proof preserves current/recovery entries and the active slot, writes and verifies the inactive candidate, unmounts, runs read-only `fsck.vfat`, remounts and re-verifies bytes. That proof is explicitly filesystem-staging-only: it does not exercise canonical release trust, authorize physical writes, activate a candidate or prove notebook boot. CI proof does not authorize destructive physical writes or substitute for hardware validation.

## Physical architecture

The capacity-independent bootstrap seed and the current transitional USB prepared by Creator are different artifacts and must not be collapsed into one partition count:

```text
BOOTSTRAP_SEED_PARTITIONS=2
BOOTSTRAP_SEED_PARTITION_NAMES=ORDAX-ESP,ORDAX
SEED_PARTITION_1_FILESYSTEM=FAT32
SEED_PARTITION_2_FILESYSTEM=EXT4
PREPARED_USB_PARTITIONS=3
PREPARED_USB_PARTITION_NAMES=ORDAX-ESP,ORDAX,ORDAX-DATA
PREPARED_PARTITION_1_FILESYSTEM=FAT32
PREPARED_PARTITION_2_FILESYSTEM=EXT4
PREPARED_PARTITION_3_FILESYSTEM=EXFAT
SEPARATE_HOME_PARTITION=NO
LEGACY_ORDAX_PLATFORM_PARTITION=FORBIDDEN
LEGACY_ORDAX_HOME_PARTITION=FORBIDDEN
```

`docs/contracts/physical-media.json` is authoritative for the two-partition capacity-independent seed (`ORDAX-ESP` + `ORDAX`). `docs/contracts/physical-prepared-media.json` is authoritative for the current **transitional Owner/Development** prepared USB (`ORDAX-ESP` + bounded `ORDAX` + target-capacity-specific `ORDAX-DATA`). These counts describe different validation artifacts and are not the final Stable/MVP layout. The legacy/transitional release tree remains validation-only and must not become the public MVP default.

The durable MVP target is portable USB v2:

```text
ORDAX-ESP   FAT32
ORDAX-DATA  exFAT
  -> .ordax/base/stable-base.erofs
  -> .ordax/releases/<commit>/system.erofs
  -> .ordax/releases/<commit>/surface-runtime.sha256
  -> .ordax/runtimes/sha256/<runtime-sha256>/native-surface-runtime.erofs
  -> .ordax/state/persistent-state.img   # ext4-in-file
```

Mutable activation authority (`current`, `known-good`, `candidate`, `rejected` and `activation-transaction.json`) lives inside the ext4 persistent-state image, never as a mutable exFAT symlink/pointer. Portable v2 remains the storage/bootstrap compatibility shape; the current Stable/MVP candidate uses signed `release-manifest/4`, binding `system.erofs`, the content-addressed Surface runtime and the content-addressed Local AI runtime/source-lock identity. `release-manifest/3` remains a verified compatibility baseline for pre-v4 devices and for the already-proven v3 activation evidence; it is not the current MVP release shape. The Stable Base remains a separate immutable minimal OS EROFS. The fixed initramfs candidate owns exact release selection, capsule/Base verification, system/runtime EROFS mounts and the read-only-to-ephemeral OverlayFS handoff; signature authority remains in the bootstrap-owned release agent. The Stable supervisor is v4-aware: it inspects the signed manifest schema, selects exact v3 or v4 materialization/verification, blocks v3 downgrade after a v4 boot, and preserves the one-shot `candidate -> cold-health -> commit/rollback` lifecycle. The dedicated disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 proof now proves boot handoff with the Local AI runtime plus safe fallback, while the older v3 one-shot proof remains compatibility evidence for candidate rejection/rollback behavior. This still does **not** prove cold-health commit, physical Stable/MVP USB boot, Secure Boot, physical known-good or physical rollback. The graphical cold-health path is intentionally not synthesized in CI: the actual product path requires Cage/Wayland/WebKit/seatd plus the native host and Surface heartbeat/health handshake with the exact release SHA, and no equivalent headless product mode is currently implemented.

The offline Stable/MVP graphical runtime is a separate EROFS artifact with a full 253-package Alpine lock and repeat-digest proof. It deliberately excludes generated machine identity and Fontconfig caches from signed bytes. Release-manifest/3 binds that runtime by SHA-256, Creator preseeds the content-addressed bytes, the candidate PID1 re-verifies v3 offline and mounts the runtime read-only beneath an ephemeral OverlayFS in `/run`, and the Stable launcher refuses boot-time `apk add` provisioning. The exact runtime-v3 handoff was proven at source `b9e1b164d7510f2dfc7572e473642b8fb885fa8c` in both direct-kernel QEMU and non-Secure-Boot OVMF/UEFI with networking disabled and no physical target touched. **This proves the signed offline runtime handoff, not a complete graphical Surface session on real hardware; the final Stable/MVP USB graphical boot remains a physical validation gate.**

Portable v2 itself has now crossed the CI boot-handoff gate with the final two-partition layout: the direct-kernel QEMU proof and the UEFI/OVMF + systemd-boot proof both reached `ORDAX_PORTABLE_V2_HANDOFF=VERIFIED` and `ORDAX_STABLE_INIT_HANDOFF=VERIFIED`, selected the exact `current` slot/source identity, ran with QEMU networking disabled, destroyed disposable guest state afterward and did not touch a physical target device. The UEFI proof uses non-Secure-Boot OVMF; **Secure Boot and physical USB boot remain unproven**.

CI proof remains distinct from physical boot evidence and does not authorize the public writer.

## Minimal bootstrap and canonical release path

The eligible Windows trust toolkit from canonical `main` source `2172eb6a18430910afd036199ec492ad63dc185d` (workflow run `35617567458`) completed operator steps 1, 2 and 3 on 2026-09-21. The uploaded `OrdaX-Public-Trust-Handoff.zip` was then independently revalidated: archive shape, exact public hashes and the recovered Ed25519 signing proof all passed. The exact public anchor is now pinned at `bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json`, the minimal bootstrap trust group is resolved and the non-release physical bindings are populated. The private key remains outside Git/USB/Actions artifacts and is not recorded here. A same-host encrypted backup copy was verified byte-for-byte; this is accepted for the first controlled prototype but is not called independent off-device custody, which remains required before broad public distribution. Public trust promotion itself did not authorize destructive media writes. On 2026-09-22 the owner provided the exact Stable/MVP authorization phrase for scope `first-real-stable-mvp-usb-proof`, release sequence 1, and that consent was correctly bound to the then-current 15-artifact writer context. The later v4 Creator migration expands the physical payload to 17 artifacts, so the old context is no longer accepted. The authorization contract now fails closed at `blocked-canonical-v4-release-proof-pending`. A read-only `Preflight-PortableV4-Canonical.ps1` now validates the three public artifacts, source-lock, canonical public trust, tooling, exact commit syntax, stable HTTPS artifact URLs and safe external private-key path metadata before the signing handoff; it does not read the private-key contents or sign. The operator-controlled canonical signing/materialization sequence must then produce the public aggregate receipt `canonical-v4-release-proof.json`; `bind_canonical_v4_release_proof.py` validates and binds that exact proof SHA/source commit/HTTPS envelope identity without touching a device; only after a fresh `authorize_physical_write.py check` passes may new owner consent be requested. Live USB revalidation, Windows UAC and target-specific destructive confirmation remain later independent gates.

The Windows destructive backend remains compile-time isolated behind `ordax_raw_backend` and unreachable from the public Creator command. The final Portable writer is now implemented inside that tagged boundary: it executes the Core-owned 39-operation `ORDAX-ESP + ORDAX-DATA` plan, with 17 exact artifacts including the Local AI runtime and its signed-release digest reference, and performs per-artifact sync/readback SHA-256+size verification without a target-sized whole-disk RAW image. **Implementation alone does not authorize use.** Canonical trust remains resolved, while the old 15-artifact authorization is intentionally stale. The exact canonical v4 release proof must be executed and bound before fresh explicit owner authorization becomes reachable for the v4 writer context. Public reachability remains closed, and choosing/revalidating a concrete USB plus Windows UAC and the target-specific destructive confirmation remain separate execution gates.

The byte-complete media workflow remains proven with ephemeral CI trust and disposable media only. That proof establishes composition and growth behavior; it does not establish canonical public trust or authorize a product-media write. The notebook development-USB boot is a separate physical proof and must not be used to collapse those boundaries.

Do not reinterpret `PASS_DEVELOPMENT_USB` as canonical release/install proof. The proven target today is the owner/development Git-first USB on the tested notebook.

The source-controlled Stable/MVP physical smoke harness is now ready for the verified Stable runtime and remains non-promotional until executed on the real Stable/MVP USB. The running Surface publishes a private ephemeral proof context, and the harness fails closed unless that context identifies the exact Owner/Development dynamic runtime or `stable-mvp + verified-erofs-overlay + canonical-stable-mvp` with its verified runtime SHA-256. The Stable graphical runtime no longer depends on or mounts a Git repository. The smoke also checks configured/applied physical keyboard state, preserves baseline/after comparison, rejects mixed runtime evidence, and requires all 11 manual tour items plus a fresh fail-closed finalization. This is source/CI readiness only: `MVP_SURFACE_SMOKE_PHYSICAL=PENDING` and `CANONICAL_STABLE_GRAPHICAL_MODE=PENDING` remain authoritative until real hardware evidence exists.

## Deferred/final physical validation

The following are intentionally left for later/final hardware validation rather than blocking current product development:

```text
SURFACE_ONLY_NATIVE_HOST_RESTART_PHYSICAL=PASS_DEVELOPMENT_USB
SUSPEND_RESUME=PENDING_FINAL
AUDIO=PENDING_FINAL
GRAPHICS_ACCELERATION_QUALITY=PENDING_FINAL
LONG_RUN_STABILITY=PENDING_FINAL
RECOVERY_PHYSICAL_EXERCISE=PENDING_FINAL
BROADER_HARDWARE_COVERAGE=PENDING_FINAL
```

## Current priorities

1. prioritize the Stable/MVP **USB system path**: preserve the green source/QEMU/UEFI path, complete canonical signed Stable v4 materialization with the proven local-AI runtime, then close the later real-hardware gates for first canonical USB boot, cold health, known-good promotion and rollback without coupling ordinary app changes to a full system reboot;
2. keep the **local inference payload** pinned and reproducible: the exact llama.cpp/model artifacts, real-byte v4 materialization and disposable QEMU/UEFI v4 path are already CI-proven; the remaining non-physical release gate is canonical Stable signing/materialization, without making AI boot-critical;
3. keep PT-BR/en-US launch coverage regression-closed and continue Spanish, German and French migration without exposing those hidden compatibility locales as complete before their Surface coverage reaches the same standard;
4. keep the current first-party apps useful and coherent as Beta components, focusing app work on correctness, regression coverage and genuine MVP gaps; move an app toward production-independent packaging only when the signed `component-slot` path is actually ready to prove it;
5. continue hardening staged/transactional Owner/Development Git-first activation while keeping it explicitly separate from the Stable/MVP public update channel;
6. execute the integrated Surface smoke only on the eventual Stable/MVP physical USB for canonical promotion; Owner/Development evidence remains development-only and CI or an unexecuted runbook must never become physical PASS;
7. continue account/cloud preference and workspace continuity through neutral contracts without making an authenticated provider or cloud sync an MVP boot dependency;
8. keep the already-pinned canonical Ed25519 public trust stable, keep private signing material outside Git/CI/chat, and treat independent off-device custody plus managed non-exportable signing as broad-distribution hardening rather than an unfinished first-prototype trust ceremony;
9. keep all physical writers fail-closed after scope authorization until non-published candidate review, exact target confirmation/UAC and post-write verification are deliberately completed; source/CI readiness alone never selects or authorizes erasing a particular USB;
10. continue product experience work that does not weaken boot safety, including the early graphical OrdaX splash with mandatory text fallback; leave suspend/resume, audio, acceleration-quality, long-run and broader-hardware exercises for final physical validation unless an MVP gate depends on them sooner.

```

The temporary Supabase project is an operational relay, not product authority. It may be migrated later without changing the device identity or telemetry contract. Git `main` remains product source authority; `ordax-rescue` remains a separate, deliberately narrow recovery path.

## Canonical documentation freshness

The Foundation regression suite compares this snapshot against structured owners for product version, first-party app versions/release modes and seed/transitional-media geometry. A source change that makes those values stale must fail CI until the canonical snapshot and nomenclature contract are updated in the same change. Portable v2 remains governed separately by `docs/contracts/portable-usb-v2.json`; transitional geometry must never be mistaken for the final public MVP target.

## Handoff rule

Any new AI/conversation must read `AGENTS.md`, this file and the canonical contracts before changing source. It must also reconcile current structured source with the snapshot before planning work from a historical statement. CI alone never proves physical boot, native graphics or destructive safety. For the tested owner/development USB notebook, physical native graphics/input/power/live-update claims are supported by `docs/evidence/physical-native-surface-2026-09-17.md`; those claims still do not promote CI trust, authorize physical mutation, prove canonical signed release acquisition or declare the product complete.


## Runtime component trust identity

The signed `component-slot` protocol intentionally uses a trust domain separate
from whole-OS release signing. Source now defines the operator ceremony and
fail-closed policy for the first component identity, but no canonical component
key is pinned yet.

```text
COMPONENT_TRUST_DOMAIN=runtime-components
COMPONENT_TRUST_KEY_ID=ordax-runtime-components-v1
COMPONENT_TRUST_CEREMONY=PENDING_OPERATOR_EXECUTION
CANONICAL_COMPONENT_TRUST_ANCHOR_PINNED=NO
COMPONENT_PUBLISH_ALLOWED=NO
PRODUCTION_COMPONENT_SLOT_ACTIVATION_ALLOWED=NO
```

Only a reviewed public anchor may later enter
`system/trust/runtime-components-ed25519.json`. The matching private key remains
external to Git/device and must pass independent derivation plus encrypted-recovery
signing proof before public pinning.

The Native Surface now has a fail-closed, read-only component-slot broker backed
by the signed `ordax-runtime-component-channel` helper. It is available only for
Stable/MVP USB when both the helper and a real component trust file exist, and it
revalidates component bytes through the verifier rather than trusting writable
slot paths directly. Source also implements the next non-activation layers: a
pending probation loader, an internal Native health recorder bound to the exact
component identity and probation revision, a system-owned nonce-bound health
bridge, and a fail-closed promotion policy that can only return hold/reject/promote
decisions. The bridge does not expose generic HTTP mutation authority and neither
the recorder nor the policy executes promotion, rejection or rollback. Because the
canonical component trust file is not pinned, the broker remains unavailable in
the current product and production component-slot activation is still blocked.
The next authority boundary is a separate Native executor consuming exact
revision+identity policy decisions only after canonical component trust and the
promotion/rollback proof gates are satisfied.

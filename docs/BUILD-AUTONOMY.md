# Build Autonomy

Status: CANONICAL FOR PROTOTYPE

## Goal

The OrdaX prototype must be buildable, testable and publishable from repository source without requiring Codex, WSL, QEMU, a developer workstation toolchain, or manual one-off build knowledge.

Codex may assist as an optional engineering partner. It is never a build owner, source authority, release authority, or prerequisite for producing OrdaX artifacts.

## Core contract

```text
CODEX_REQUIRED=NO
LOCAL_DEVELOPER_TOOLCHAIN_REQUIRED=NO
WSL_REQUIRED=NO
QEMU_REQUIRED=NO
MANUAL_KERNEL_BUILD_REQUIRED=NO
REPOSITORY_RECIPE_REQUIRED=YES
REPRODUCIBLE_CI_BUILD_REQUIRED=YES
ARTIFACT_PROVENANCE_REQUIRED=YES
ARTIFACT_SHA256_REQUIRED=YES
```

`main` owns the source and build recipes. CI is an execution environment, not a second source authority.

## Build chain

Target flow:

```text
source commit
 -> repository build recipe
 -> pinned build environment
 -> dependency/source hash verification
 -> build affected artifact
 -> tests/verification
 -> provenance manifest
 -> SHA-256
 -> immutable CI artifact/release candidate
```

A person or AI must not need to remember undocumented commands to reproduce an artifact.

## Kernel

The kernel is not a special manual exception.

The repository must contain or identify:

- exact kernel version;
- official source location/identity;
- expected source archive SHA-256;
- canonical OrdaX kernel config;
- canonical patch set, if any;
- pinned compiler/toolchain environment;
- deterministic build entrypoint;
- expected output names;
- module/firmware packaging rules;
- tests and boot evidence;
- generated provenance manifest.

The developer host does not compile the kernel as a prerequisite. A repository CI runner executes the canonical recipe in a pinned environment.

Initial selected baseline remains Linux 6.6.52 until an explicit architecture decision changes it.

## Pinned build environment

Build tooling must be represented declaratively and pinned strongly enough to avoid "works only on that machine" behavior.

Preferred model:

```text
repository source
 + pinned OCI/container build environment by immutable digest
 + pinned upstream source checksums
 + versioned build scripts/config
```

GitHub Actions is the current automation executor because this repository is hosted on GitHub. The architecture must not depend on GitHub Actions-specific behavior: the same build entrypoint should be runnable by another standards-compatible CI/container executor later.

Linux-based CI may be used to compile the Linux kernel. This is an implementation environment, not a requirement that the OrdaX developer own or configure a Linux/WSL workstation.

## Artifact graph

The build graph is dependency-driven rather than one monolithic pipeline. Canonical classes are:

```text
kernel
initramfs
minimal-bootstrap
shared-system-bundle
public-site
web-client
mobile-client
desktop-client
native-system-release
creator
manifests
```

The shared product source may feed several delivery modes, but those delivery artifacts remain independently selectable. The public product portal is also a separate artifact: a change under `sites/public/` must not rebuild the kernel, bootstrap, shared system bundle or product clients. A shared Surface change may legitimately rebuild all applicable product modes; it must not rebuild the kernel. A mobile-adapter-only change must not rebuild unrelated Web/Desktop/native targets. A kernel change may rebuild the dependent bootstrap, but not client modes.

`docs/contracts/build-autonomy.json` version 2 records the dependency relationships and the following scaling rules:

- affected-build selection follows the artifact dependency graph;
- CI path filters are only an optimization and never become dependency authority;
- shared contract changes trigger cross-mode validation;
- unrelated rebuilds are architectural regressions, not an accepted cost of growth;
- missing a required dependent build is also an architectural regression;
- dependency cycles are forbidden;
- new artifact classes require a provenance owner;
- caches may accelerate a verified build but may not replace verification.

This lets future targets and features be added without turning every commit into a kernel/full-product rebuild. The `public-site` artifact is owned by `tools/public-site/build.py` and its contract in `docs/contracts/public-site.json`; it is intentionally distinct from the `web-client` product mode.

## Native system release assembly

The `native-system-release` is not identical to a raw copy of the shared `system/` tree. Some privileged Native capabilities require prebuilt host executables that browsers and shared JavaScript must never implement directly.

Those binaries are assembled through the repository-owned recipe:

```text
tools/native-release-assembly/build.py
```

The recipe copies the canonical shared `system/` source into an isolated temporary tree, cross-compiles only explicitly contracted Native helper packages, records their hashes/provenance, and hands the staged tree to the existing deterministic release bundler. No generated helper is committed into `system/`, no compiler is required on the end-user device, and no helper escapes the signed `system.tar` release boundary.

## Release provenance

Every boot-critical generated artifact must have machine-readable provenance containing at least:

```text
source_commit
recipe_version_or_path
upstream_source_identity
upstream_source_sha256
toolchain_identity
build_environment_identity
artifact_sha256
build_timestamp_or_reproducible_epoch
```

Where reproducible byte-for-byte builds are practical, they are preferred and should be tested. Where they are not yet byte-reproducible, provenance and integrity must still be explicit.

## ChatGPT / AI operating model

Any capable repository agent should be able to:

```text
read canonical docs
 -> edit source/config/build recipes
 -> commit/push main
 -> observe CI
 -> inspect failures
 -> correct source
 -> validate produced artifacts and hashes
```

No step in this loop may require Codex specifically.

Codex can still be useful for optional parallel review, hardware-local investigation, or a second opinion. Results from Codex become evidence only after they are represented or verified through canonical repository contracts.

## Physical boundary

Repository/CI autonomy does not mean a cloud agent can physically press keys, change firmware settings, or write a USB attached to a user's computer without an authorized device-side/host-side tool.

Physical operations are performed through OrdaX Creator or another explicitly authorized local mechanism. The Creator consumes signed/hashed artifacts generated from repository source; it does not invent or compile them locally for the end user.

Therefore:

```text
SOURCE_AND_BUILD_AUTONOMY=YES
CODEX_DEPENDENCY=NO
USER_LOCAL_BUILD_DEPENDENCY=NO
PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ACTION_STILL_REQUIRES_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_EXECUTION=YES
```

## Failure rule

If CI is unavailable, source must remain reproducible from the versioned build recipe in another compatible container executor. CI availability must not redefine source truth.

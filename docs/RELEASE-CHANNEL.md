# Release Channel

Status: CANONICAL FOR PROTOTYPE

## Goal

This channel is the delivery authority for the **Stable/MVP** distribution. Owner/Development may continue to use the Git-first path, but that mechanism is internal and is not the end-user update contract. The machine-readable separation lives in `docs/contracts/distribution-profiles.json`.

`main` remains source authority, while an OrdaX device consumes prebuilt immutable releases without needing a compiler, source checkout, Codex or a full Git client in the pre-release bootstrap.

Repository CI owns build/sign/publication. The device consumes a compact signed release envelope and immutable artifacts over HTTPS.

## Source vs delivery

```text
GitHub main
 -> CI build graph
 -> exact source commit
 -> immutable release artifacts
 -> signed release envelope
 -> HTTPS publication
 -> OrdaX release acquisition agent
 -> signature/hash verification
 -> /ordax/releases/<commit>
 -> /ordax/current
```

Git owns what OrdaX is. Delivery only selects bytes for a particular source commit.

## Canonical bootstrap selector

The prototype seed now pins this source-controlled channel file:

```text
bootstrap/config/release-envelope-url
```

with exactly:

```text
https://github.com/washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os/releases/latest/download/release-envelope.json
```

GitHub documents `/releases/latest/download/<asset>` as a direct download form for an asset on the latest Release. The `latest` pointer is intentionally mutable as a **selector**, while the release identity and authenticated payload remain immutable after verification.

Runtime path:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/config/release-envelope-url
```

The exact file bytes are SHA-256 bound in `docs/contracts/minimal-bootstrap.json`.

## Security model

HTTPS is mandatory transport but not the authenticity authority.

The device must carry a local Ed25519 public trust anchor at:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json
```

Expected schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-trust/1",
  "key_id": "prototype-1",
  "public_key_base64": "<32-byte Ed25519 public key>"
}
```

The corresponding private key must never be committed to Git, embedded in Creator/USB media, bundled in Desktop, or published as an artifact.

Current state:

```text
RELEASE_CHANNEL=RESOLVED
RELEASE_TRUST=UNRESOLVED
PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY_CUSTODY=NOT_YET_ESTABLISHED
PHYSICAL_WRITE_ALLOWED=NO
```

No placeholder key may satisfy the trust gate.

## Signed envelope

The release endpoint serves:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-envelope/1",
  "payload": "<base64 exact manifest bytes>",
  "signature": "<base64 Ed25519 signature over exact payload bytes>",
  "key_id": "prototype-1"
}
```

The signature is over the decoded payload bytes exactly as carried. No custom canonical-JSON signing algorithm is used.

## Signed manifest

Decoded payload schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-manifest/1",
  "source_repository": "washingtonmsdj/prototipo-ordax-os",
  "source_commit": "<lowercase 40-hex>",
  "release_id": "<same source commit>",
  "created_from_ci_recipe": "release/native/1",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "name": "system.tar",
      "role": "system",
      "url": "https://...",
      "sha256": "<lowercase 64-hex>",
      "size": 123
    }
  ]
}
```

The release agent rejects unknown fields, unsafe names, non-HTTPS artifact URLs, malformed commits/hashes, duplicate artifact names, repository mismatch, key-id mismatch, signature failure, size mismatch and SHA-256 mismatch.

## Release identity

Each prototype release is tied to exactly one lowercase 40-hex source commit and uses that commit as both `release_id` and directory identity:

```text
/ordax/releases/<source_commit>
```

Reusing the same release identity for different bytes is forbidden.

## Transactional materialization

```text
fetch signed envelope
 -> verify signature + manifest policy
 -> create /ordax/releases/.staging-<commit>-*
 -> download artifacts
 -> verify exact size + SHA-256
 -> fsync files/staging
 -> store exact signed manifest payload
 -> rename staging -> releases/<commit>
 -> fsync releases
 -> stop here for A/B materialize mode
 -> atomically replace current symlink only for install mode
 -> fsync /ordax
```

`current` changes only after every candidate byte has passed authentication and integrity checks, and only when the caller explicitly uses the bootstrap `install` mode.

The A/B base-update owner uses `materialize --expected-commit <checkout>`. That mode requires the signed source commit to match the running checkout exactly and ends after immutable release materialization; it must not change `/ordax/current`. The exact verified release envelope is persisted as `release-envelope.json` beside the signed payload in `release-manifest.json`. An existing release may be reused only when envelope, signed payload, artifact and extracted tree still match; divergence fails closed. The persisted envelope is the only envelope the later A/B staging owner may consume, so staging never needs a second network fetch of signing authority.

## Failure/offline behavior

```text
network unavailable before first release -> recovery
release endpoint unavailable before first release -> recovery
signature invalid -> reject candidate + recovery/current preserved
artifact invalid -> reject candidate + recovery/current preserved
known-good current exists -> boot it without requiring network
```

After the first verified release, network is an update dependency rather than a normal boot dependency.

## Publication target

GitHub Releases is the current prototype host. The protocol remains host-neutral because signed manifests carry ordinary HTTPS artifact URLs.

The next source-side step is to implement repository-owned signing/publication that:

- reads private signing material only from an external CI secret or similarly protected signer;
- derives/validates the corresponding public key identity;
- signs exact manifest bytes with standard Ed25519;
- publishes immutable assets for the exact source commit;
- publishes `release-envelope.json` under the GitHub Release;
- refuses publication when provenance, hashes, source commit or signing material are incomplete.

Publication must not be enabled by committing a private key.

## Product modes

```text
Web       -> deployment refresh from shared source commit
Desktop   -> signed desktop application update
USB       -> signed OrdaX release acquisition/activation
Native    -> signed OrdaX release acquisition/activation
```

The Desktop application updater is a separate trust/update concern and must not silently mutate removable media.

## Codex independence

```text
CODEX_REQUIRED_FOR_BUILD=NO
CODEX_REQUIRED_FOR_PUBLICATION=NO
CODEX_REQUIRED_FOR_DEVICE_UPDATE=NO
```

A running device consumes the release protocol, not an AI-specific transport.

## Promotion boundary

The acquisition agent, channel and generated artifacts remain candidates until signed publication, disposable acquisition/activation, virtual/physical boot, rollback and offline-known-good gates pass.

```text
PHYSICAL_ARTIFACT_AUTHORIZED=NO
```


## Stable runtime polling

The Stable/MVP runtime reuses the shared `system/supervisor`, but it does not poll Git.

The Stable profile has two explicit runtime layouts. The legacy-tree path keeps its existing exact activation transaction. The MVP Portable path uses release-manifest/3 and never creates the legacy `/ordax/current` symlink:

```text
official HTTPS channel
 -> ordax-release-agent inspect
 -> verify signed envelope + trust + exact source_commit
 -> ordax-release-agent materialize-portable-v3 --expected-commit
 -> ordax-release-agent verify-portable-v3-exact
 -> immutable .ordax/releases/<commit> + content-addressed runtime
 -> ordax-portable-state prepare
 -> reboot
 -> initramfs ordax-portable-state select-boot
 -> one candidate boot only
 -> Stable Surface cold-health
 -> commit current/known-good OR persist rejected + rollback
```

`materialize-portable-v3` and `verify-portable-v3-exact` remain **non-activating primitives**. Activation authority is the ext4 Portable state transaction plus the shared supervisor health policy. No Git is required for activation or rollback. The source path is connected, but the current transaction must still pass its disposable update/rollback proof and later the physical Stable/MVP USB gate before being called product-proven.

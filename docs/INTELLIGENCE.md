# Ordax Intelligence

Status: **MVP SYSTEM FOUNDATION**

Ordax Intelligence is a system capability, not an application.

The first-party Assistant may later provide a conversational Surface, but it is
only a client. Files, Notes, Search, Settings, diagnostics and future automation
may consume the same system intelligence contract without opening an Assistant
window.

## Layering

```text
Surface / applications
 -> shared OrdaX services and Workspace context
 -> Ordax Intelligence
 -> model router
 -> AI Runtime / local inference backend
 -> llama.cpp + verified local model (initial implementation)
```

`ordax.intelligence/1` owns product intelligence semantics. The inference
backend remains behind `ordax.local-ai/1`. Engine and model may therefore be
replaced without redefining the OrdaX Intelligence contract.

## MVP policy

The Stable/MVP distribution is expected to include local inference by default
as part of the product. It is **not** a Creator opt-out feature.

This does not make AI boot-critical. A missing, incompatible or failed model
must degrade Intelligence while the operating system, recovery, files and
updates remain usable. The signed engine/model payload and its actual Stable USB
materialization are separate release gates and must not be claimed merely
because the source contract exists.

The initial source lock targets a small Qwen3.5 GGUF profile served by
`llama.cpp`, so the first MVP does not assume a discrete GPU. A later signed
update may replace the model, quantization or inference engine without changing
the stable Intelligence API.

The release layer has a dedicated v4 source contract for this payload.
`prototype-ordax.release-manifest/4` keeps the system image and Surface runtime
semantics from v3, adds `local-ai-runtime.erofs`, and signs a binding to the
canonical engine/model source lock. Surface and AI runtimes are independently
content-addressed and verified. The real engine/model EROFS is reproducibly proven
in CI, and the Portable v2/Stable Base handoff now supports exact v4 verification,
read-only mounting at `/run/ordax/runtime/local-ai`, and non-boot-critical loopback
backend startup. A dedicated non-promotional CI gate now signs a v4 envelope with
an ephemeral CI-only key, materializes the three artifacts over loopback HTTPS using
the real built AI EROFS, revalidates the release offline and byte-compares the
content-addressed stored AI runtime. This still does not claim a promoted Stable/MVP
artifact: canonical-key Stable v4 signing/materialization plus disposable v4 boot and
physical proof remain release gates.

## Memory and model routing

The pre-MVP foundation separates persistent product memory from inference providers:

```text
ordax.intelligence/1
  +-- ordax.memory/1
  +-- ordax.model-router/1
        +-- ordax.local-ai/1
        +-- OpenAI adapter (future)
        +-- xAI adapter (future)
        +-- future providers
```

The source-level model router is active in the Intelligence runtime. MVP requests map the
Intelligence intent to a provider-neutral purpose and resolve the active local model through
`ordax.model-router/1`. A route is executable only while the local backend is actually `ready`;
`busy`, `stopped`, `error` and `unavailable` fail closed. External providers remain fail-closed
even when an egress approval is present because their runtime adapters are not enabled yet. A
local route binds both `engineId` and `modelId`; the result must match both identities, so a silent
engine or model change between routing and inference fails closed while normal engine/model
migration between releases remains behind the same stable Intelligence boundary.

Memory belongs to OrdaX. llama.cpp, GPT, Grok or another model may receive authorized context, but none of them becomes the owner of persistent memory.

Memory scopes are device, account, Space, project and session. Ownership is an explicit pair:
`ownerKind=device` has no account `subjectId`, while `ownerKind=account` requires the authenticated
account subject. This lets local-only/offline mode own device, Space, project and session memory
without inventing a fake account identity. Device-owned memory cannot request the `account` scope
and is never eligible for implicit cloud sync; account-scoped memory requires an account owner.
Update, delete, review and retrieval compare both owner kind and owner id.

Signing in adds an account owner; it does **not** replace the device owner or migrate device memory.
The owner resolver always keeps the trusted device owner available and exposes the authenticated
account owner only while the identity session is actually signed in. Signing out drops the account
owner and review state falls back to device memory. Any future migration/copy between those owners
must therefore be an explicit product operation, not a side effect of authentication.

Persistent items carry provenance, source timestamp and sensitivity. The source-level memory
runtime implements bounded `search`, `remember`, `forget` and `flush` over `ordax.memory/1`, with a
bounded `ordax.memory-store/1` snapshot boundary. Search applies owner/Space/project filters before
local lexical ranking, restricted items require explicit inclusion, item IDs cannot change owner,
and device stores never persist session-scoped memory. Search is paginated through a bounded
offset instead of raising the result cap, so user review can reach older items without creating an
unbounded read.

A dedicated memory-review runtime owns the user-review semantics above the stable port. It can
list, edit and remove only inside one explicit owner/Space/project boundary. Editing may change
content, provenance and sensitivity, but cannot silently change item identity, owner kind, owner
id, kind, scope, Space or project. Review of more than one page walks the same bounded search API
instead of gaining a privileged bypass. A review-session layer switches explicitly between the
currently available device/account owners, and a Surface-ready view model adds bounded search,
one-item pagination lookahead and generic `idle/pending/saved/error` persistence state. That is
presentation plumbing only; a visual review surface is still not claimed as mounted in the MVP.

Secret material is not memory. The contract rejects explicit secret items and known private-key
or token-shaped material in both **content and provenance** before either can enter persistence or
model context. Semantic embeddings remain derived indexes: replacing an embedding model does not
change the identity of the underlying memory item. A local semantic index is still not claimed;
current local retrieval is intentionally lexical until an approved embedding owner exists.

The source also has explicit persistence and retrieval boundaries. Web uses a local browser
memory store. If persistent browser storage is unavailable, its fallback is explicitly
**session-only**: it may keep only `scope=session` items and rejects device/account/Space/project
memory instead of pretending that an ephemeral in-memory value is durable. Native has a dedicated
device-store adapter plus a bounded private state owner for
`/var/lib/ordax/intelligence-memory.json`; that helper rejects session-scoped state, invalid owner
metadata, malformed item fields, duplicate IDs, non-canonical timestamps, secret-shaped content or
provenance, symlinks, non-private targets and oversized payloads. It writes through `0600`
temporary files with file+directory `fsync` and atomic replacement. The JS snapshot contract and
the Native owner share an exact **8 MiB** serialized ceiling, so the runtime cannot accept a
durable snapshot that the host would later reject solely because of payload size.

Store acceptance and durable completion are separate. A synchronous store rejection does not
mutate the memory runtime state. Every store exposes `flush()`: Web/session stores confirm
immediately after their synchronous save path, while the Native adapter waits for its queued POST
and surfaces a host persistence failure instead of swallowing it. Native persistence tracks desired
and durable revisions. If a queued POST fails, `flush()` retries the current desired snapshot once;
a newer successful revision supersedes an older failure, so a redundant retry cannot report a
false failure after the current state is already durable. This keeps `remember()` and `forget()`
synchronous without pretending an asynchronous Native write is already durable.

Authorized memory-to-Intelligence context is a separate boundary. `ordax.memory-context-auth/1`
accepts only authorization produced by the composition layer, including the exact owner kind/id
and allowed device/account/Space/project/session scopes. Retrieval re-checks owner kind/id, Space,
project and restricted sensitivity even after the memory port returns results, caps the context to
eight items and excerpts each item to the existing Intelligence context bounds. Canonical memory
IDs are preserved without adding a prefix, so a valid 160-character memory ID cannot overflow the
Intelligence context-ID bound.

When both device and account context are desired, composition must supply a separate authorization
for each owner. The multi-owner helper never infers the second grant from login state: it retrieves
each authorized owner independently and round-robins the shared bounded context budget, preventing
one owner from silently replacing or starving the other. A user prompt therefore cannot grant
itself access to another owner, Space or project.

Native persistence is now wired end-to-end at the platform boundary: the loopback-only Native host
owns `GET/POST /__ordax/native/intelligence-memory`, delegates validation and private atomic state
ownership to the dedicated memory endpoint/helper, and Native composition probes the device store
fail-soft before creating `ordax.memory/1`. If persistence is unavailable or corrupt, the Surface
and local inference still mount without memory. Memory is **not automatically injected** into
ordinary Intelligence requests: composition must explicitly choose the trusted device owner or a
real authenticated account owner and apply the current Space/project authorization before calling
the memory-context boundary.

External routes require an explicit egress decision. Local AI remains the offline baseline when an external provider is unavailable or not authorized.

Professional Profile Packs may influence retrieval sources and preferred model purpose, but they cannot bypass Space membership, memory authorization or tool permissions.

## Authority and input boundary

The MVP Intelligence runtime is consultative:

- no implicit file writes;
- no implicit command or shell execution;
- no implicit external network access;
- no package installation;
- no system or disk mutation;
- no silent cloud fallback;
- no privilege gained from prompt text.

The local backend receives these immutable Intelligence rules as an OpenAI-compatible `system`
message, while the user request and authorized provenance-bearing context remain in the `user`
message. This does not make prompt injection impossible, but it stops ordinary context text from
sharing the same message role as the system authority policy. The Local AI client enforces the
runtime endpoint literally before URL canonicalization: only lower-case `http://127.0.0.1` with an
optional valid port is accepted. Hostname aliases, integer/octal/hex loopback forms, trailing-dot
hosts, userinfo, external addresses and HTTPS endpoints are rejected for this local-only port.
Configured `engineId`/`modelId` are validated before any network work, and discovered model identity
uses the same bounded validator.

The Local AI user-message ceiling is 32,768 characters. Intelligence reserves a small render margin
by limiting the direct user request to 32,000 characters, then fits supplemental authorized context
inside the remaining backend budget. The user request is preserved; context is clipped or omitted
first and receives an explicit local-input-budget marker when that happens. A valid large context
can therefore no longer accidentally overflow `ordax.local-ai/1` after Intelligence adds intent,
purpose, provenance and framing metadata.

Backend responses are bounded before JSON parsing in the production fetch path. Model discovery is
limited to **256 KiB** and the OpenAI-compatible completion envelope to **1 MiB**; the accepted
completion text is then limited again to **131,072 characters** and rejects NUL. Streaming body
consumption remains inside the same probe/inference timeout, so a server that sends headers and
then stalls the body cannot bypass the deadline. Oversized/malformed completion data is treated as
an inference failure and receives the same bounded health revalidation as other backend failures.

Backend request failure is not treated as permanent service death. After an inference failure the
runtime performs a bounded `/health` revalidation: a healthy backend returns to `ready`, while a
missing backend degrades to `stopped`. It does not silently retry the failed generation. `probe()`
will not reset a currently `busy` inference, and `dispose()` aborts active fetches and refuses new
probe/generate work so shutdown cannot leave hidden inference requests running.

Context supplied to Intelligence is bounded and carries provenance. Tool execution, agents and broader capability bridges still require their own explicit contracts and permissions before activation. The memory runtime does not grant tool authority and does not bypass current authorization.

## Nova OrdaX reference

The legacy `novo-ordax-os` architecture correctly separated **Ordax
Intelligence** from the **AI Runtime / Inference Broker** and treated Surface
apps as clients. This prototype reimplements those architecture invariants
clean-room; it does not copy the legacy runtime, agents or permission system.
The exact reuse decision is recorded in `docs/SOURCE-MIGRATION.md`.

# Product Modes

Status: CANONICAL FOR PROTOTYPE

## One product, five execution modes

OrdaX is one product with one identity, one Surface, one application model and shared synchronized state.

```text
OrdaX Web
   -> OrdaX Mobile (Android / iPhone; Tablet por layout responsivo)
   -> OrdaX Desktop
   -> OrdaX OS — USB
   -> OrdaX OS — Nativo
```

These are capability targets, not separate products or forks. The stable internal IDs remain `web`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `usb` and `native-disk`. The public names and version ownership are defined once in `system/contracts/product-family.mjs` (registered by `docs/contracts/branding.json`); the machine-readable capability policy stays in `docs/contracts/product-capabilities.json`.

**OrdaX OS** is the bootable operating system, with **USB** and **Nativo** as installation/execution variants of the *same OS*, not independent version series. **OrdaX Mobile** is an Android/iOS client app, not a mobile operating system. **OrdaX Tablet** may be a responsive presentation of the same Mobile mode; it does not create a sixth mode or another app source. **OrdaX Studio** is an application distributed through the Apps owner, not an execution mode. The public portal is not OrdaX Web.

Version numbering is not inferred from platform names. The OS modes share the real prototype version from `system/contracts/product-version.mjs`. Web, Mobile and Desktop may advance their own package/deployment versions independently **when their actual verified artifacts exist**; this contract assigns no hypothetical APK, desktop installer or Web release version. Availability and public download authorization remain with the respective release owners, not branding.

## MVP integration scope versus enabled public modes

The **implementation scope** of the integrated MVP includes every materially started capability across OS, Apps, Runtime and Platform, including the OrdaX Native installer for SSD/NVMe/HDD. An implemented source slice is not automatically an authorized public feature.

```text
Current public-candidate execution: USB only (not yet public release)
Integrated MVP target:            USB plus Native disk, after independent gates
Other initiated modes/capabilities: inventory, integrate, test and promote by capability
Currently unavailable:           no fabricated Mobile APK, Native APPLY or public device runtime
```

Machine-readable `stable-mvp` still describes **current activation**: USB-only, Native capability disabled, internal-disk destructive writes forbidden. These flags must remain fail-closed until verified install, first-boot health, rollback/recovery and explicit per-target authorization are implemented and proven. The target scope in `MVP.md` does not bypass those runtime gates.

### 1. OrdaX Web

Runs in a browser with the smallest native capability envelope. It is the zero-install entry point and must use the real shared Surface and app source.

### 2. OrdaX Mobile

Runs as a normally installed Android or iOS application and uses the same OrdaX account, shared application model and design system.

Mobile is not a reduced Desktop port. It is its own first-class capability target: stronger than Web for notifications, camera/media, secure device storage, biometrics and offline use, but intentionally without raw-disk, boot-media or arbitrary privileged-host authority.

Android- and iOS-specific behavior must remain behind the mobile capability adapter. The product Surface and app logic must not fork into separate Android/iPhone implementations unless a platform rule makes a thin native bridge unavoidable.

### 3. OrdaX Desktop

A normally installed desktop application for Windows first, with other host platforms allowed later. It is the intermediate tier between browser/mobile access and the bootable operating system.

It provides capabilities a browser cannot safely or reliably provide, including controlled local filesystem access, native notifications, background tasks where allowed, local application integration, signed automatic updates and the privileged Creator capability for preparing OrdaX USB media.

OrdaX Desktop is not the OrdaX operating system and must never own raw host hardware by default. Privileged operations require a narrow, explicit capability boundary and separate user authorization.

### 4. OrdaX OS — USB

Boots the real OrdaX operating system from removable media. It owns the machine while booted and therefore has substantially broader capabilities than Web, Mobile or Desktop.

### Runtime mode identity

USB and Native Disk deliberately share the same signed `system.tar`, Surface source and Native adapter. Their execution mode is **not** inferred from bus type, filesystem layout or the presence of an installer helper.

The bootstrap carries one explicit, hash-pinned marker:

```text
/ordax/bootstrap/config/product-mode
```

Allowed values are exactly:

```text
usb
native-disk
```

The bootstrap exports that value as `ORDAX_PRODUCT_MODE`; guardian, supervisor and Surface preserve it. In the **currently active Stable/MVP profile**, Native installation remains unavailable even though its technical foundation is present. A later release within the integrated MVP cycle may activate it only through explicit product/hardware/security gates and authorization.

The future installer writes `native-disk` into the target bootstrap as part of installation materialization. This remains configuration of one product mode, not a code or release fork.

### 5. OrdaX OS — Nativo — integrated MVP target, not yet available

Installs the OrdaX operating system to SSD/NVMe/HDD using the shared signed release and a whole-disk, informed-destructive-consent flow. This work is **in scope for the integrated MVP**, while physical APPLY, boot without USB and recovery are not yet homologated; therefore the mode is **not yet an available user-facing capability**.

## One account across all devices

The user has one OrdaX identity, not one account per device or product mode.

```text
one OrdaX account
  -> Web session
  -> Android phone/tablet
  -> iPhone/iPad
  -> Windows Desktop
  -> OrdaX USB
  -> OrdaX Native
```

When cross-device services are implemented, signing in on another supported device may restore the safe synchronized portion of the user's environment according to account entitlements and device capability.

For the MVP, Web, Mobile and synchronization are not active product promises; they may be shown only as **Coming soon / Em breve**. Account architecture stays ready for them without inventing billing or device limits now.

See `docs/ACCOUNT-SYNC-AND-PLANS.md`.

## Single-source Surface

The same source files implement the visual shell, apps, settings, design tokens and shared interaction behavior for every supported mode where that UI is applicable.

```text
system/surface/      # one visual source
system/apps/         # one app source
system/services/     # shared service/domain logic
system/adapters/     # environment capabilities only
```

Target adapters:

```text
system/adapters/web/
system/adapters/mobile/
system/adapters/desktop/
system/adapters/native/
```

`mobile` owns Android/iOS capability differences; `native` is shared by USB and internal OrdaX installations wherever the capability is genuinely the same.

Forbidden architecture includes separate application trees such as `apps-android/`, `apps-ios/`, `apps-desktop/` or independent Surface forks. Thin native bridges are allowed only for genuine platform APIs.

## Capability adapters

Differences between execution environments live only behind capability interfaces. Examples include filesystem access, networking details, camera/media, biometrics, native notifications, background tasks, installer/update operations, raw removable-device access and boot-media creation.

The UI consumes capability contracts, not platform-specific APIs directly.

## Mobile Companion capability provider

OrdaX Mobile may expose selected phone/tablet capabilities to other authorized OrdaX clients.

```text
phone camera/microphone/location/sensors
 -> Android/iOS platform permission
 -> OrdaX capability consent
 -> short-lived grant
 -> encrypted transport / capability adapter
 -> authorized OrdaX app or device
```

Examples include using the phone camera as a future virtual webcam on Desktop/Native, using the
phone microphone as OrdaX Intelligence voice input, capturing documents directly into a Space and
finding account-owned devices with explicit location opt-in.

This is not unrestricted remote access to the phone. Camera/microphone cannot be activated silently,
location tracking is off by default, and the source phone must show active-session state and allow
revocation.

See `docs/MOBILE-COMPANION.md`.

## Mobile security boundary

Mobile clients must use platform secure storage for device-bound credentials/tokens where appropriate and must never receive release signing keys, device-private keys from another installation, raw disk authority or arbitrary privileged-command capabilities.

Biometric authentication may gate local access to a session or secret, but it does not replace the canonical account/authentication model.

## Desktop security boundary

The Desktop application separates its unprivileged UI/runtime from privileged host operations. The privileged helper exposes explicit operations rather than arbitrary command execution. Raw disk access is reserved for removable-media creation/recovery and fails closed on ambiguous device identity.

## Update model

All modes evolve from versioned source, but installation mechanics differ:

```text
Web       -> deployment refresh
Mobile    -> signed/store application update
Desktop   -> signed application update
USB       -> verified OrdaX release activation
Native    -> verified OrdaX release activation
```

Client application updates and OrdaX OS releases are distinct delivery channels even when both originate from the same repository commit.

## Synchronization model

Safe, meaningful user state follows the user's OrdaX identity across modes. Examples include appearance, preferences, workspace metadata, app-state metadata and user-selected cloud content.

Device-local secrets never synchronize. Examples include private device keys, machine identity secrets, hardware drivers, raw disk state and ephemeral caches.

Sync must be offline-tolerant, server-authorized, encrypted in transit and have an explicit conflict-resolution model before production promotion.

## Operational realtime and remote device actions

All product modes share one operational domain model in addition to account synchronization.

```text
portable account/user state -> OrdaX Sync
live orders/jobs/telemetry -> OrdaX Operational Realtime
device mutation intent -> OrdaX Action Gateway -> Device Agent
```

Web and Mobile do not get separate order databases, printer queues or authorization rules.
They consume the same versioned events and action contracts as Desktop/Native according to
their capability envelope.

The current publicly eligible USB candidate remains USB-only. The broader MVP integration scope includes already-started Web/PWA/Mobile slices, to be enabled by separately proven capabilities without redesigning Account, Spaces or Device Agent.
There is currently **no released OrdaX APK and no public remote-device runtime**.

See `docs/OPERATIONAL-REALTIME.md`.

## OrdaX Edge Runtime — infrastructure role

OrdaX Edge Runtime is **not** a sixth product mode and does not add another Surface. It is a
headless infrastructure role used when a local physical device needs an always-on bridge.

```text
OrdaX Web / Mobile / Desktop / USB / Native
             |
             v
        OrdaX Cloud
             |
        Action Gateway
             |
      OrdaX Edge Runtime
             |
      local equipment
```

A user's notebook must not be the required production host. When equipment can run the connector
itself, use device-native execution. When it cannot, a dedicated low-power Edge host can keep the
integration alive while notebooks and normal clients are off.

Cloud-native services such as a future marketplace/order service do not need Edge at all for their
core availability. Edge is added only for local hardware integrations.

Loss of electrical power to local equipment is outside software availability. UPS/power recovery
may be supported as hardware capabilities, but the product must not claim that Cloud or Edge keeps
an unpowered device online.

## Plans and future monetization

Pricing, billing, commercial tier names and device-count limits are intentionally undefined at MVP stage.

The entitlement architecture remains prepared for future value-bearing services such as synchronization capacity, cloud storage, backup/restore, cross-device continuity, collaboration, premium compute and support. The product direction is to monetize ecosystem value, not to charge arbitrarily for a second device.

Device registration is a security/session boundary first. No current commercial device limit is defined, and no client-claimed entitlement is authoritative.


## Promotion path

A user can gain capability without changing product identity:

```text
OrdaX Web / Mobile
  -> sign in and restore synchronized environment
  -> optionally install OrdaX Desktop
  -> optionally create OrdaX USB inside Desktop
  -> boot OrdaX USB
  -> restore synchronized environment
  -> optionally install OrdaX Native on SSD/HD
```

The goal is continuity of identity, Surface, apps and safe synchronized user state across every tier while keeping each environment's authority boundary explicit.

## Canonical Web presentation cutover — 2026-10-10

The approved workspace presentation lives under system/surface/workspace and
uses the official Web build. One composition, one root dependency lock and
shared symbol/font sources remain, with no evaluation route or redirect.
Pending app interfaces are preserved. Real service wiring is the next phase:
presentation asserts no authenticated session, user files, inference, sync,
package installation or remote-device access. Native operational UI, services,
contracts and public Account are preserved. See docs/DESKTOP-IDENTITY.md and
migration ledger 007. This is a source/candidate change, not production activation.

# OrdaX Release Signing

`tools/release-signing/` owns the host-neutral utility for the public/private boundary of the OrdaX release protocol.

It uses only the Go standard library and standard Ed25519/PKCS#8 primitives. It does not own release publication, device provisioning or physical-media authorization.

## Commands

```text
ordax-release-signing generate-key \
  --private-key <external-path>/ordax-release-private.pem \
  --trust <review-path>/release-ed25519.json \
  --key-id prototype-1

ordax-release-signing derive-trust \
  --private-key <external-path>/ordax-release-private.pem \
  --out <review-path>/release-ed25519.json \
  --key-id prototype-1

ordax-release-signing sign \
  --manifest release-manifest.json \
  --private-key <external-path>/ordax-release-private.pem \
  --trust <canonical-public-path>/release-ed25519.json \
  --key-id prototype-1 \
  --out release-envelope.json
```

## Portable v4 signing handoff

Before the canonical private key is touched, the Windows operator tooling can prepare a
public-only signing directory:

```powershell
.\3-Prepare-PortableV4-SigningHandoff.ps1 \
  -SystemImagePath <system.erofs> \
  -SurfaceRuntimePath <native-surface-runtime.erofs> \
  -LocalAiRuntimePath <local-ai-runtime.erofs> \
  -LocalAiSourceLockPath <source-lock.json> \
  -SourceCommit <40-hex-commit> \
  -SystemArtifactUrl <https-url> \
  -SurfaceArtifactUrl <https-url> \
  -LocalAiArtifactUrl <https-url> \
  -OutputDirectory <empty-directory>
```

The preparer copies only public material, verifies SHA-256 after every copy, builds the
exact release-manifest/4, carries the canonical public trust and signer, and emits a
public handoff receipt. It does not accept a private-key parameter, publish a release,
activate a release or authorize physical media. The canonical private key is introduced
only when the operator later runs `4-Sign-Initial-OrdaXRelease.ps1` from that reviewed
handoff directory.

## Private-key boundary

The private key:

- must be a regular non-symlink PKCS#8 Ed25519 PEM file;
- must be `0600` on Unix-like systems;
- is never printed by the CLI;
- is never copied into a trust file or envelope;
- is never accepted from the repository as canonical custody;
- must not be committed, uploaded as a build artifact, placed on the USB seed or shipped inside OrdaX Desktop.

All outputs use exclusive creation. Existing files are never silently replaced.

`generate-key` exists to support an explicit key ceremony on a trusted operator/signing host. Generating a key in CI, a disposable runner or an arbitrary developer temp directory does **not** make that key a canonical release key.

## Trust anchor

`derive-trust` emits only:

```json
{
  "$schema": "prototype-ordax.release-trust/1",
  "key_id": "prototype-1",
  "public_key_base64": "<32 raw Ed25519 public-key bytes in base64>"
}
```

The public trust anchor may enter `bootstrap/trust/release-ed25519.json` only after the matching private key has an explicit custody owner and recovery/rotation policy outside Git.

The `sign` command requires the public trust anchor as an explicit input. Before producing an envelope it derives the public key from the supplied private key and requires all of the following to match:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY_PUBLIC_COMPONENT == TRUST_PUBLIC_KEY
SIGNING_KEY_ID == TRUST_KEY_ID
TRUST_SCHEMA == prototype-ordax.release-trust/1
```

A mismatch fails before output creation. This prevents an operator or CI job from producing an apparently valid envelope with a private key that the bootstrapped device can never trust.

## Signing

Before signing, the tool validates an explicitly supported manifest schema. V1 remains immutable for the legacy tar path; v2/v3/v4 extend the portable USB EROFS path without redefining older schemas.

For v1:

- exact schema;
- expected source repository;
- lowercase 40-hex source commit;
- `release_id == source_commit`;
- bounded CI recipe identifier;
- exactly one artifact;
- artifact name exactly `system.tar`;
- artifact role exactly `system`;
- HTTPS artifact URL;
- exact SHA-256 syntax and positive bounded size.

For v2, the signer requires exactly one `system.erofs` artifact with role `system-image` and exact signed identity `product_mode=usb`, `storage_profile=portable-usb-v2`, `runtime_format=erofs`.

For v3, it additionally requires the exact `native-surface-runtime.erofs` artifact with role `surface-runtime`.

For v4, it additionally requires the exact `local-ai-runtime.erofs` artifact with role `local-ai-runtime` plus the bounded `ordax.local-ai/1` source/model binding: source-lock SHA-256, pinned engine repository/commit/license and pinned model repository/revision/SHA-256/size/license. The signer refuses a v4 manifest whose AI binding or artifact ordering/roles drift from the protocol.

The signature is standard Ed25519 over the **exact manifest file bytes**. Whitespace is preserved in the signed payload. The output envelope remains `prototype-ordax.release-envelope/1`; envelope and manifest versions evolve independently.

Signer support does not authorize publication, activation or physical-media writes. The repository already proves v4 signing/materialization with an ephemeral CI-only key. The remaining Stable/MVP gate is an operator-controlled signing/materialization run using the canonical private key outside Git, followed by disposable v4 boot proof before any physical USB write.

## Signing backends and custody evolution

The release protocol and device verifier must not depend on where the private signing operation is hosted.

Current controlled-prototype backend:

```text
local-pem
 -> explicit local Ed25519 private key
 -> canonical ceremony + recovery proof
 -> never committed or distributed
```

Future production custody target:

```text
managed-kms-hsm
 -> non-exportable operational signing key
 -> short-lived workload authorization (for example OIDC)
 -> no permanent private-key file on the developer workstation
```

The managed backend is intentionally deferred while the prototype does not justify paid infrastructure. AWS KMS is a candidate implementation, not a protocol dependency. GitHub may orchestrate builds and obtain short-lived authorization, but it is not private-key custody. Before broad public distribution, signed trust rotation must exist so an operational key can be revoked/replaced without redefining release-manifest/envelope semantics or reprovisioning every device.
## Signed trust transition protocol

Trust rotation is a separate versioned protocol; it does not change `release-envelope/1` or any published release-manifest semantics.

The source candidate implements:

```text
prototype-ordax.release-trust-transition/1
 -> exact source repository
 -> positive monotonic sequence
 -> exact previous key id
 -> SHA-256 of the exact current trust file
 -> canonical next release-trust/1 object
 -> SHA-256 of canonical next trust

prototype-ordax.release-trust-transition-envelope/1
 -> exact transition payload
 -> Ed25519 signature by the CURRENT trusted key
 -> current key id
```

Local-PKCS#8 tooling can create the protocol envelope today:

```text
ordax-release-signing sign-trust-transition \
  --current-private-key <current-private.pem> \
  --current-trust <current-release-ed25519.json> \
  --next-trust <next-release-ed25519.json> \
  --sequence <N> \
  --out <trust-transition.json>
```

Both the signer and `ordax-release-agent` independently verify the transition. Verification may materialize only a new canonical next-trust file; it does **not** overwrite the current trust:

```text
ordax-release-agent verify-trust-transition \
  --envelope <trust-transition.json> \
  --current-trust <current-release-ed25519.json> \
  --expected-sequence <N> \
  --out-next-trust <verified-next-trust.json>
```

The verifier fails closed on a wrong sequence, wrong current trust bytes, wrong current key id, tampering, repository mismatch, reuse of the same Ed25519 key under another id, or a next-trust hash mismatch.

**Important:** stateful device activation is not implemented yet. The current protocol proves safe authorization of a successor key but does not yet change the effective trust used by an installed OrdaX. Production rotation remains `NO` until a persistent monotonic trust-state owner and bootstrap effective-trust selection are implemented and proven.

## CI policy

Repository CI may generate an ephemeral test key solely to prove the signing protocol and tooling. CI also proves that the signer refuses private/trust mismatches and that the resulting envelope is accepted by the real release-acquisition agent.

Such a key remains strictly test scoped:

```text
CI_TEST_KEY=YES
CANONICAL_TRUST_ANCHOR=NO
PHYSICAL_BOOTSTRAP_TRUST=NO
PRIVATE_KEY_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD=NO
```

The production/canonical private key must come from a separate explicit custody decision.
